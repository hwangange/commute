  <p id="fs-idp58109104">Sleep is not a uniform state of being. Instead, sleep is composed of several different stages that can be differentiated from one another by the patterns of brain wave activity that occur during each stage. These changes in brain wave activity can be visualized using EEG and are distinguished from one another by both the frequency and amplitude of brain waves (<a href="#Figure_04_03_SleepCycle" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Sleep can be divided into two different general phases: REM sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. <span data-type="term">Rapid eye movement (REM)</span> sleep is characterized by darting movements of the eyes under closed eyelids. Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves during wakefulness. In contrast, <span data-type="term">non-REM (NREM)</span> sleep is subdivided into four stages distinguished from each other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves. The first four stages of sleep are NREM sleep, while the fifth and final stage of sleep is REM sleep. In this section, we will discuss each of these stages of sleep and their associated patterns of brain wave activity. </p><figure id="Figure_04_03_SleepCycle"><figcaption>Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep.

    <p id="fs-idp58027264">The first stage of NREM sleep is known as stage 1 sleep. <span data-type="term">Stage 1 sleep</span> is a transitional phase that occurs between wakefulness and sleep, the period during which we drift off to sleep. During this time, there is a slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat. In addition, stage 1 sleep involves a marked decrease in both overall muscle tension and core body temperature.</p> 
    <p id="fs-idp14745440">In terms of brain wave activity, stage 1 sleep is associated with both alpha and theta waves. The early portion of stage 1 sleep produces <span data-type="term">alpha waves</span>, which are relatively low frequency (8&#8211;13Hz), high amplitude patterns of electrical activity (waves) that become synchronized (<a href="#Figure_04_03_Stages" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). This pattern of brain wave activity resembles that of someone who is very relaxed, yet awake. As an individual continues through stage 1 sleep, there is an increase in theta wave activity. <span data-type="term">Theta waves</span> are even lower frequency (4&#8211;7 Hz), higher amplitude brain waves than alpha waves. It is relatively easy to wake someone from stage 1 sleep; in fact, people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage 1 sleep.</p>

    <p id="fs-idm135950400">As we move into <span data-type="term">stage 2 sleep</span>, the body goes into a state of deep relaxation. Theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain, but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles (<a href="#Figure_04_03_Stage2" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). A <span data-type="term">sleep spindle</span> is a rapid burst of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory (Fogel &amp; Smith, 2011; Poe, Walsh, &amp; Bjorness, 2010). In addition, the appearance of K-complexes is often associated with stage 2 sleep. A <span data-type="term">K-complex</span> is a very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in some cases occur in response to environmental stimuli. Thus, K-complexes might serve as a bridge to higher levels of arousal in response to what is going on in our environments (Hal&#225;sz, 1993; Steriade &amp; Amzica, 1998).</p>

    <p id="fs-idm132022896"><span data-type="term">Stage 3</span> and <span data-type="term">stage 4</span> of sleep are often referred to as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep because these stages are characterized by low frequency (up to 4 Hz), high amplitude <span data-type="term">delta waves</span> (<a href="#Figure_04_03_Deltawaves" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). During this time, an individual&#8217;s heart rate and respiration slow dramatically. It is much more difficult to awaken someone from sleep during stage 3 and stage 4 than during earlier stages. Interestingly, individuals who have increased levels of alpha brain wave activity (more often associated with wakefulness and transition into stage 1 sleep) during stage 3 and stage 4 often report that they do not feel refreshed upon waking, regardless of how long they slept (Stone, Taylor, McCrae, Kalsekar, &amp; Lichstein, 2008).</p>

    <p id="fs-idm98619632">As mentioned earlier, REM sleep is marked by rapid movements of the eyes. The brain waves associated with this stage of sleep are very similar to those observed when a person is awake, as shown in <a href="#Figure_04_03_REM" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, and this is the period of sleep in which dreaming occurs. It is also associated with paralysis of muscle systems in the body with the exception of those that make circulation and respiration possible. Therefore, no movement of voluntary muscles occurs during REM sleep in a normal individual; REM sleep is often referred to as paradoxical sleep because of this combination of high brain activity and lack of muscle tone. Like NREM sleep, REM has been implicated in various aspects of learning and memory (Wagner, Gais, &amp; Born, 2001), although there is disagreement within the scientific community about how important both NREM and REM sleep are for normal learning and memory (Siegel, 2001).</p>

    <p id="fs-idm107552160">If people are deprived of REM sleep and then allowed to sleep without disturbance, they will spend more time in REM sleep in what would appear to be an effort to recoup the lost time in REM. This is known as the REM rebound, and it suggests that REM sleep is also homeostatically regulated. Aside from the role that REM sleep may play in processes related to learning and memory, REM sleep may also be involved in emotional processing and regulation. In such instances, REM rebound may actually represent an adaptive response to stress in nondepressed individuals by suppressing the emotional salience of aversive events that occurred in wakefulness (Suchecki, Tiba, &amp; Machado, 2012).</p>
    <p id="fs-idm4213072">While sleep deprivation in general is associated with a number of negative consequences (Brown, 2012), the consequences of REM deprivation appear to be less profound (as discussed in Siegel, 2001). In fact, some have suggested that REM deprivation can actually be beneficial in some circumstances. For instance, REM sleep deprivation has been demonstrated to improve symptoms of people suffering from major depression, and many effective antidepressant medications suppress REM sleep (Riemann, Berger, &amp; Volderholzer, 2001; Vogel, 1975).</p> 
    <p id="fs-idm181655808">It should be pointed out that some reviews of the literature challenge this finding, suggesting that sleep deprivation that is not limited to REM sleep is just as effective or more effective at alleviating depressive symptoms among some patients suffering from depression. In either case, why sleep deprivation improves the mood of some patients is not entirely understood (Giedke &amp; Schw&#228;rzler, 2002). Recently, however, some have suggested that sleep deprivation might change emotional processing so that various stimuli are more likely to be perceived as positive in nature (Gujar, Yoo, Hu, &amp; Walker, 2011). The hypnogram below (<a href="#Figure_04_03_Hypnogram" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) shows a person&#8217;s passage through the stages of sleep.</p><figure id="Figure_04_03_Hypnogram"><figcaption>A hypnogram is a diagram of the stages of sleep as they occur during a period of sleep.

       <p id="fs-idm31249056">The meaning of dreams varies across different cultures and periods of time. By the late 19th century, German psychiatrist Sigmund <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Freud</span> had become convinced that dreams represented an opportunity to gain access to the unconscious. By analyzing dreams, Freud thought people could increase self-awareness and gain valuable insight to help them deal with the problems they faced in their lives. Freud made distinctions between the manifest content and the latent content of dreams. <span data-type="term">Manifest content</span> is the actual content, or storyline, of a dream. <span data-type="term">Latent content</span>, on the other hand, refers to the hidden meaning of a dream. For instance, if a woman dreams about being chased by a snake, Freud might have argued that this represents the woman&#8217;s fear of sexual intimacy, with the snake serving as a symbol of a man&#8217;s penis.</p>
      <p id="fs-idm29982832">Freud was not the only theorist to focus on the content of dreams. The 20th century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung believed that dreams allowed us to tap into the collective unconscious. The <span data-type="term">collective unconscious</span>, as described by <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Jung</span>, is a theoretical repository of information he believed to be shared by everyone. According to Jung, certain symbols in dreams reflected universal archetypes with meanings that are similar for all people regardless of culture or location.</p> 
      <p id="fs-idm29876928">The sleep and dreaming researcher Rosalind Cartwright, however, believes that dreams simply reflect life events that are important to the dreamer. Unlike Freud and Jung, Cartwright&#8217;s ideas about dreaming have found empirical support. For example, she and her colleagues published a study in which women going through divorce were asked several times over a five month period to report the degree to which their former spouses were on their minds. These same women were awakened during REM sleep in order to provide a detailed account of their dream content. There was a significant positive correlation between the degree to which women thought about their former spouses during waking hours and the number of times their former spouses appeared as characters in their dreams (Cartwright, Agargun, Kirkby, &amp; Friedman, 2006). Recent research (Horikawa, Tamaki, Miyawaki, &amp; Kamitani, 2013) has uncovered new techniques by which researchers may effectively detect and classify the visual images that occur during dreaming by using fMRI for neural measurement of brain activity patterns, opening the way for additional research in this area.</p>
      <p id="fs-idp61673568">Recently, neuroscientists have also become interested in understanding why we dream. For example, Hobson (2009) suggests that dreaming may represent a state of protoconsciousness. In other words, dreaming involves constructing a virtual reality in our heads that we might use to help us during wakefulness. Among a variety of neurobiological evidence, John Hobson cites research on lucid dreams as an opportunity to better understand dreaming in general. <span data-type="term">Lucid dreams</span> are dreams in which certain aspects of wakefulness are maintained during a dream state. In a lucid dream, a person becomes aware of the fact that they are dreaming, and as such, they can control the dream&#8217;s content (LaBerge, 1990).</p>

  <section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm29059008" class="summary"><h3 data-type="title">Summary</h3><p id="fs-idm30624160">The different stages of sleep are characterized by the patterns of brain waves associated with each stage. As a person transitions from being awake to falling asleep, alpha waves are replaced by theta waves. Sleep spindles and K-complexes emerge in stage 2 sleep. Stage 3 and stage 4 are described as slow-wave sleep that is marked by a predominance of delta waves. REM sleep involves rapid movements of the eyes, paralysis of voluntary muscles, and dreaming. Both NREM and REM sleep appear to play important roles in learning and memory. Dreams may represent life events that are important to the dreamer. Alternatively, dreaming may represent a state of protoconsciousness, or a virtual reality, in the mind that helps a person during consciousness.</p>

The notion that &#8220;sometimes a cigar is just a cigar&#8221; (sometimes attributed to Freud but not definitively shown to be his) makes it clear that there is no systematic, objective system in place for dream analysis.</p>
