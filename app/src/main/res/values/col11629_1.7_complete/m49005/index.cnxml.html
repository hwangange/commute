<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1422228"><h3 data-type="title">Peripheral Nervous System</h3>
<p id="fs-id1547472">The peripheral nervous system is made up of thick bundles of axons, called nerves, carrying messages back and forth between the CNS and the muscles, organs, and senses in the periphery of the body (i.e., everything outside the CNS). The PNS has two major subdivisions: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p id="fs-id1731967">The <span data-type="term">somatic nervous system</span> is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary. It is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS; therefore, it consists of motor neurons and sensory neurons. Motor neurons, carrying instructions from the CNS to the muscles, are efferent fibers (efferent means &#8220;moving away from&#8221;). Sensory neurons, carrying sensory information to the CNS, are afferent fibers (afferent means &#8220;moving toward&#8221;). Each nerve is basically a two-way superhighway, containing thousands of axons, both efferent and afferent.</p>
<p id="fs-id1580778">The <span data-type="term">autonomic nervous system</span> controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be outside the realm of voluntary control. It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions (<a href="#CNX_Psych_03_03_Autonomic" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The <span data-type="term">sympathetic nervous system</span> is involved in preparing the body for stress-related activities; the <span data-type="term">parasympathetic nervous system</span> is associated with returning the body to routine, day-to-day operations. The two systems have complementary functions, operating in tandem to maintain the body&#8217;s homeostasis. <span data-type="term">Homeostasis</span> is a state of equilibrium, in which biological conditions (such as body temperature) are maintained at optimal levels.</p>

<figure id="CNX_Psych_03_03_Autonomic"><figcaption>The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system have the opposite effects on various systems.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-id1729655" data-alt="A diagram of a human body lists the different functions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic system can constrict pupils, stimulate salivation, slow heart rate, constrict bronchi, stimulate digestion, stimulate bile secretion, and cause the bladder to contract. The sympathetic nervous system can dilate pupils, inhibit salivation, increase heart rate, dilate bronchi, inhibit digestion, stimulate the breakdown of glycogen, stimulate secretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline, and inhibit contraction of the bladder.">

<p id="fs-id1566614">The sympathetic nervous system is activated when we are faced with stressful or high-arousal situations. The activity of this system was adaptive for our ancestors, increasing their chances of survival. Imagine, for example, that one of our early ancestors, out hunting small game, suddenly disturbs a large bear with her cubs. At that moment, his body undergoes a series of changes&#8212;a direct function of sympathetic activation&#8212;preparing him to face the threat. His pupils dilate, his heart rate and blood pressure increase, his bladder relaxes, his liver releases glucose, and adrenaline surges into his bloodstream. This constellation of physiological changes, known as the <span data-type="term">fight or flight response</span>, allows the body access to energy reserves and heightened sensory capacity so that it might fight off a threat or run away to safety.</p>

<p id="fs-id1516446">Reinforce what you&#8217;ve learned about the nervous system by playing this BBC-produced <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/bbcgame">interactive game</a> about the nervous system.</p>
</div><p id="fs-id1590023">While it is clear that such a response would be critical for survival for our ancestors, who lived in a world full of real physical threats, many of the high-arousal situations we face in the modern world are more psychological in nature. For example, think about how you feel when you have to stand up and give a presentation in front of a roomful of people, or right before taking a big test. You are in no real physical danger in those situations, and yet you have evolved to respond to any perceived threat with the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">fight or flight</span> response. This kind of response is not nearly as adaptive in the modern world; in fact, we suffer negative health consequences when faced constantly with psychological threats that we can neither fight nor flee. Recent research suggests that an increase in susceptibility to heart disease (Chandola, Brunner, &amp; Marmot, 2006) and impaired function of the immune system (Glaser &amp; Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005) are among the many negative consequences of persistent and repeated exposure to stressful situations.</p>

<p id="fs-id1523937">Once the threat has been resolved, the parasympathetic nervous system takes over and returns bodily functions to a relaxed state. Our hunter&#8217;s heart rate and blood pressure return to normal, his pupils constrict, he regains control of his bladder, and the liver begins to store glucose in the form of glycogen for future use. These processes are associated with activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1558542" class="summary"><h3 data-type="title">Summary</h3>
<p id="fs-id1505796">The brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is comprised of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system transmits sensory and motor signals to and from the central nervous system. The autonomic nervous system controls the function of our organs and glands, and can be divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Sympathetic activation prepares us for fight or flight, while parasympathetic activation is associated with normal functioning under relaxed conditions.</p>
