<title>The Structure of the Atom</title>
<para id="fs-idp140338798858736">To understand how elements come together, we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element, the atom. An <term>atom</term> is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element. For example, one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature. A gold coin is simply a very large number of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin and containing small amounts of other elements known as impurities. Gold atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of gold.</para>
<para id="fs-idp140338804724160">An atom is composed of two regions: the <term>nucleus</term>, which is in the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons, and the outermost region of the atom which holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus, as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch02_01_01" document=""/>. Atoms contain protons, electrons, and neutrons, among other subatomic particles. The only exception is hydrogen (H), which is made of one proton and one electron with no neutrons.</para>
    <figure id="fig-ch02_01_01" class=" "><media id="fs-idp140338808766608" alt="This illustration shows that, like planets orbiting the sun, electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom. The nucleus contains two neutrally charged neutrons, and two positively charged protons represented by spheres. A single, circular orbital surrounding the nucleus contains two negatively charged electrons on opposite sides.">

        </media>
<caption>Elements, such as helium, depicted here, are made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the nucleus, with electrons in orbitals surrounding the nucleus.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idp140338797859808">Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67 × 10<sup>-24</sup> grams. Scientists arbitrarily define this amount of mass as one atomic mass unit (amu) or one Dalton, as shown in <link target-id="tab-ch02_01_02" document=""/>. Although similar in mass, protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge. A <term>proton</term> is positively charged whereas a <term>neutron</term> is uncharged. Therefore, the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass, but not to its charge. <term>Electrons</term> are much smaller in mass than protons, weighing only 9.11 × 10<sup>-28</sup> grams, or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit. Hence, they do not contribute much to an element’s overall atomic mass. Therefore, when considering atomic mass, it is customary to ignore the mass of any electrons and calculate the atom’s mass based on the number of protons and neutrons alone. Although not significant contributors to mass, electrons do contribute greatly to the atom’s charge, as each electron has a negative charge equal to the positive charge of a proton. In uncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. In these atoms, the positive and negative charges cancel each other out, leading to an atom with no net charge.</para>
<para id="fs-idp140338796885040">Accounting for the sizes of protons, neutrons, and electrons, most of the volume of an atom—greater than 99 percent—is, in fact, empty space. With all this empty space, one might ask why so-called solid objects do not just pass through one another. The reason they do not is that the electrons that surround all atoms are negatively charged and negative charges repel each other.</para>

<title>Atomic Number and Mass</title>
<para id="fs-idp140338804903648">Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons. The number of protons determines an element’s <term>atomic number</term> and is used to distinguish one element from another. The number of neutrons is variable, resulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess. Together, the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element’s <term>mass number</term>, as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch02_01_02" document=""/>. Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number. This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number. Since an element’s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine the <term>atomic mass</term>, which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes. Often, the resulting number contains a fraction. For example, the atomic mass of chlorine (Cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes, some (the majority) with atomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20 neutrons).</para>

<title>Carbon Dating</title>
Carbon is normally present in the atmosphere in the form of gaseous compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. Carbon-14 (<sup>14</sup>C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere from atmospheric <sup>14</sup>N (nitrogen) by the addition of a neutron and the loss of a proton because of cosmic rays. This is a continuous process, so more <sup>14</sup>C is always being created. As a living organism incorporates <sup>14</sup>C initially as carbon dioxide fixed in the process of photosynthesis, the relative amount of <sup>14</sup>C in its body is equal to the concentration of <sup>14</sup>C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting <sup>14</sup>C, so the ratio between <sup>14</sup>C and <sup>12</sup>C will decline as <sup>14</sup>C decays gradually to <sup>14</sup>N by a process called beta decay—the emission of electrons or positrons. This decay gives off energy in a slow process.</para>
<para id="fs-idp140338807733920">After approximately 5,730 years, half of the starting concentration of <sup>14</sup>C will have been converted back to <sup>14</sup>N. The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay back to its more stable form is called its half-life. Because the half-life of <sup>14</sup>C is long, it is used to date formerly living objects such as old bones or wood. Comparing the ratio of the <sup>14</sup>C concentration found in an object to the amount of <sup>14</sup>C detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope that has not yet decayed can be determined. On the basis of this amount, the age of the material, such as the pygmy mammoth shown in <link target-id="fig-ch02_01_03" document=""/>, can be calculated with accuracy if it is not much older than about 50,000 years. Other elements have isotopes with different half lives. For example, <sup>40</sup>K (potassium-40) has a half-life of 1.25 billion years, and <sup>235</sup>U (Uranium 235) has a half-life of about 700 million years. Through the use of radiometric dating, scientists can study the age of fossils or other remains of extinct organisms to understand how organisms have evolved from earlier species.</para>

<title>The Periodic Table</title>
<para id="fs-idp140338800663552">The different elements are organized and displayed in the <term>periodic table</term>. Devised by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907) in 1869, the table groups elements that, although unique, share certain chemical properties with other elements. The properties of elements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature: they may be gases, solids, or liquids. Elements also have specific <term>chemical reactivity</term>, the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other.</para>
<para id="fs-idp140338796612976">In the periodic table, shown in <link target-id="fig-ch02_01_04" document=""/>, the elements are organized and displayed according to their atomic number and are arranged in a series of rows and columns based on shared chemical and physical properties. In addition to providing the atomic number for each element, the periodic table also displays the element’s atomic mass. Looking at carbon, for example, its symbol (C) and name appear, as well as its atomic number of six (in the upper left-hand corner) and its atomic mass of 12.11.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch02_01_04" class=" "><media id="fs-idp140338805019840" alt="The periodic table consists of eighteen groups and seven periods. Two additional rows of elements, known as the lanthanides and actinides, are placed beneath the main table. The lanthanides include elements 57 through 71 and belong in period seven between groups three and four. The actinides include elements 89 through 98 and belong in period eight between the same groups. These elements are placed separately to make the table more compact. For each element, the name, atomic symbol, atomic number, and atomic mass are provided. The atomic number is a whole number that represents the number of protons. The atomic mass, which is the average mass of different isotopes, is estimated to two decimal places. For example, hydrogen has the atomic symbol H, the atomic number 1, and an atomic mass of 1.01. The atomic mass is always larger that the atomic number. For most small elements, the atomic mass is approximately double the atomic number as the number of protons and neutrons is about equal. The elements are divided into three categories: metals, nonmetals and metalloids. These form a diagonal line from period two, group thirteen to period seven, group sixteen. All elements to the left of the metalloids are metals, and all elements to the right are nonmetals.">

<para id="fs-idp140338797198608">An early model of the atom was developed in 1913 by Danish scientist Niels Bohr (1885–1962). The Bohr model shows the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with the electrons in circular <term>orbitals</term> at specific distances from the nucleus, as illustrated in <link target-id="fig-ch02_01_05" document=""/>. These orbits form electron shells or energy levels, which are a way of visualizing the number of electrons in the outermost shells.

<caption>The Bohr model was developed by Niels Bohrs in 1913. In this model, electrons exist within principal shells. An electron normally exists in the lowest energy shell available, which is the one closest to the nucleus. Energy from a photon of light can bump it up to a higher energy shell, but this situation is unstable, and the electron quickly decays back to the ground state. In the process, a photon of light is released.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idp140338797044128">Electrons fill orbitals in a consistent order: they first fill the orbitals closest to the nucleus, then they continue to fill orbitals of increasing energy further from the nucleus. If there are multiple orbitals of equal energy, they will be filled with one electron in each energy level before a second electron is added. The electrons of the outermost energy level determine the energetic stability of the atom and its tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms to form molecules.</para>
<para id="fs-idp140338797044384">Under standard conditions, atoms fill the inner shells first, often resulting in a variable number of electrons in the outermost shell. The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight electrons. This is known as the <term>octet rule</term>, which states, with the exception of the innermost shell, that atoms are more stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their <term>valence shell</term>, the outermost electron shell. Examples of some neutral atoms and their electron configurations are shown in <link target-id="fig-ch02_01_06" document=""/>. Notice that in this <link target-id="fig-ch02_01_06" document=""/>, helium has a complete outer electron shell, with two electrons filling its first and only shell.

</note><para id="fs-idp140338806026832">Understanding that the organization of the periodic table is based on the total number of protons (and electrons) helps us know how electrons are distributed among the outer shell. The periodic table is arranged in columns and rows based on the number of electrons and where these electrons are located. Take a closer look at the some of the elements in the table’s far right column in <link target-id="fig-ch02_01_04" document=""/>. The group 18 atoms helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar) all have filled outer electron shells, making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability; they are highly stable as single atoms. Their non-reactivity has resulted in their being named the <term>inert gases</term> (or <term>noble gases</term>). Compare this to the group 1 elements in the left-hand column. These elements, including hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), and sodium (Na), all have one electron in their outermost shells. That means that they can achieve a stable configuration and a filled outer shell by donating or sharing one electron with another atom or a molecule such as water. Hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration, while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable. As a result of losing a negatively charged electron, they become positively charged <term>ions</term>. Group 17 elements, including fluorine and chlorine, have seven electrons in their outmost shells, so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules, making them negatively charged ions. Group 14 elements, of which carbon is the most important to living systems, have four electrons in their outer shell allowing them to make several covalent bonds (discussed below) with other atoms. Thus, the columns of the periodic table represent the potential shared state of these elements’ outer electron shells that is responsible for their similar chemical characteristics.</para>

If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons, 11 neutrons, and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. It is now referred to as a sodium ion. Chlorine (Cl) in its lowest energy state (called the ground state) has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons, 17 neutrons, and 18 electrons, giving it a net negative (–1) charge. It is now referred to as a chloride ion. In this example, sodium will donate its one electron to empty its shell, and chlorine will accept that electron to fill its shell. Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium cation) or –1 (chloride anion) charge.

These bonds are stronger and much more common than ionic bonds in the molecules of living organisms. Covalent bonds are commonly found in carbon-based organic molecules, such as our DNA and proteins. Covalent bonds are also found in inorganic molecules like H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub>. One, two, or three pairs of electrons may be shared, making single, double, and triple bonds, respectively. The more covalent bonds between two atoms, the stronger their connection. Thus, triple bonds are the strongest.</para><para id="fs-idp140338805937584">The strength of different levels of covalent bonding is one of the main reasons living organisms have a difficult time in acquiring nitrogen for use in constructing their molecules, even though molecular nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>, is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere. Molecular nitrogen consists of two nitrogen atoms triple bonded to each other and, as with all molecules, the sharing of these three pairs of electrons between the two nitrogen atoms allows for the filling of their outer electron shells, making the molecule more stable than the individual nitrogen atoms. This strong triple bond makes it difficult for living systems to break apart this nitrogen in order to use it as constituents of proteins and DNA.</para>
<para id="fs-idp140338804795680">The formation of water molecules provides an example of covalent bonding. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds, as shown in <link target-id="fig-ch02_01_08" document=""/>. The electron from the hydrogen splits its time between the incomplete outer shell of the hydrogen atoms and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atoms. To completely fill the outer shell of oxygen, which has six electrons in its outer shell but which would be more stable with eight, two electrons (one from each hydrogen atom) are needed: hence the well-known formula H<sub>2</sub>O. The electrons are shared between the two elements to fill the outer shell of each, making both elements more stable.</para>

<title>Polar Covalent Bonds</title>
<para id="fs-idp140338802227312">There are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar. In a <term>polar covalent bond</term>, shown in <link target-id="fig-ch02_01_11" document=""/>, the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other. Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements, a slightly positive (<emphasis effect="italics">δ</emphasis>+) or slightly negative (<emphasis effect="italics">δ</emphasis>–) charge develops. This partial charge is an important property of water and accounts for many of its characteristics.</para><para id="fs-idp140338804492768">Water is a polar molecule, with the hydrogen atoms acquiring a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial negative charge. This occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen’s electrons. Thus oxygen has a higher <term>electronegativity</term> than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms, giving the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges, respectively. Another way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus. Either way, the atom’s relative electronegativity contributes to the development of partial charges whenever one element is significantly more electronegative than the other, and the charges generated by these polar bonds may then be used for the formation of hydrogen bonds based on the attraction of opposite partial charges. (Hydrogen bonds, which are discussed in detail below, are weak bonds between slightly positively charged hydrogen atoms to slightly negatively charged atoms in other molecules.) Since macromolecules often have atoms within them that differ in electronegativity, polar bonds are often present in organic molecules.</para></section>

<title>Nonpolar Covalent Bonds</title>
<para id="fs-idp140338799846288"><term>Nonpolar covalent bonds</term> form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons equally. For example, molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two oxygen atoms.</para>
<para id="fs-idp140338804490560">Another example of a nonpolar covalent bond is methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), also shown in <link target-id="fig-ch02_01_11" document=""/>. Carbon has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It gets these four from four hydrogen atoms, each atom providing one, making a stable outer shell of eight electrons. Carbon and hydrogen do not have the same electronegativity but are similar; thus, nonpolar bonds form. The hydrogen atoms each need one electron for their outermost shell, which is filled when it contains two electrons. These elements share the electrons equally among the carbons and the hydrogen atoms, creating a nonpolar covalent molecule.</para>
<figure id="fig-ch02_01_11" class=" "><media id="fs-idp140338805989184" alt="Table compares water, methane and carbon dioxide molecules. In water, oxygen has a stronger pull on electrons than hydrogen resulting in a polar covalent O-H bond. Likewise in carbon dioxide the oxygen has a stronger pull on electrons than carbon and the bond is polar covalent. However, water has a bent shape because two lone pairs of electrons push the hydrogen atoms together so the molecule is polar. By contrast carbon dioxide has two double bonds that repel each other, resulting in a linear shape. The polar bonds in carbon dioxide cancel each other out, resulting in a nonpolar molecule. In methane, the bond between carbon and hydrogen is nonpolar and the molecule is a symmetrical tetrahedron with hydrogens spaced as far apart as possible on the three-dimensional sphere. Since methane is symmetrical with nonpolar bonds, it is a nonpolar molecule.">

<section id="fs-idp140338797683184"><title>Hydrogen Bonds and Van Der Waals Interactions</title><para id="fs-idp140338797683824">Ionic and covalent bonds between elements require energy to break.  Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent, which determines their behavior in biological systems. However, not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can also form between molecules. Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. Without these two types of bonds, life as we know it would not exist. Hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical, life-sustaining properties of water and also stabilize the structures of proteins and DNA, the building block of cells.</para><para id="fs-idp140338806173648">When polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form, the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because hydrogen’s electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen. Because the hydrogen is slightly positive, it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges. When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the <emphasis effect="italics">δ</emphasis><sup>+</sup>of the hydrogen from one molecule and the <emphasis effect="italics">δ</emphasis>– charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule, usually oxygen or nitrogen, or within the same molecule. This interaction is called a <term>hydrogen bond</term>. This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules. Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken; however, they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers, creating a major force in combination. Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA double helix.</para><para id="fs-idp140338806175616">Like hydrogen bonds, <term>van der Waals interactions</term> are weak attractions or interactions between molecules. Van der Waals attractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities, which are not always symmetrical around an atom. For these attractions to happen, the molecules need to be very close to one another. These bonds—along with ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds—contribute to the three-dimensional structure of the proteins in our cells that is necessary for their proper function.</para><note id="fs-idp140338804794304" class="career">

<title>Pharmaceutical Chemist</title>
Pharmaceutical chemists are responsible for the development of new drugs and trying to determine the mode of action of both old and new drugs. They are involved in every step of the drug development process. Drugs can be found in the natural environment or can be synthesized in the laboratory. In many cases, potential drugs found in nature are changed chemically in the laboratory to make them safer and more effective, and sometimes synthetic versions of drugs substitute for the version found in nature.</para>
<para id="fs-idp140338805878000">After the initial discovery or synthesis of a drug, the chemist then develops the drug, perhaps chemically altering it, testing it to see if the drug is toxic, and then designing methods for efficient large-scale production. Then, the process of getting the drug approved for human use begins. In the United States, drug approval is handled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and involves a series of large-scale experiments using human subjects to make sure the drug is not harmful and effectively treats the condition it aims to treat. This process often takes several years and requires the participation of physicians and scientists, in addition to chemists, to complete testing and gain approval.</para><para id="fs-idp140338804755008">An example of a drug that was originally discovered in a living organism is Paclitaxel (Taxol), an anti-cancer drug used to treat breast cancer. This drug was discovered in the bark of the pacific yew tree. Another example is aspirin, originally isolated from willow tree bark. Finding drugs often means testing hundreds of samples of plants, fungi, and other forms of life to see if any biologically active compounds are found within them. Sometimes, traditional medicine can give modern medicine clues to where an active compound can be found. For example, the use of willow bark to make medicine has been known for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Egypt. It was not until the late 1800s, however, that the aspirin molecule, known as acetylsalicylic acid, was purified and marketed for human use.</para>
<para id="fs-idp140338806211664">Occasionally, drugs developed for one use are found to have unforeseen effects that allow these drugs to be used in other, unrelated ways. For example, the drug minoxidil (Rogaine) was originally developed to treat high blood pressure. When tested on humans, it was noticed that individuals taking the drug would grow new hair. Eventually the drug was marketed to men and women with baldness to restore lost hair.</para>
