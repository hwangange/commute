It is grounded on an evolutionary basis and includes exciting features that highlight careers in the biological sciences and everyday applications of the concepts at hand. To meet the needs of today&#8217;s instructors and students, some content has been strategically condensed while maintaining the overall scope and coverage of traditional texts for this course. Instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom. Biology also includes an innovative art program that incorporates critical thinking and clicker questions to help students understand&#8212;and apply&#8212;key concepts.</div>
    <p id="import-auto-id6057858">Welcome to <em data-effect="italics">Biology</em>, an OpenStax resource. This textbook was written to increase student access to high-quality learning materials, maintaining highest standards of academic rigor at little to no cost. </p><section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1164185993559"><h3 data-type="title">About OpenStax</h3>
      <p id="import-auto-id1164193596448">OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and it&#8217;s our mission to improve student access to education. Our first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012, and our library has since scaled to over 20 books for college and AP courses used by hundreds of thousands of students. Our adaptive learning technology, designed to improve learning outcomes through personalized educational paths, is being piloted in college courses throughout the country. Through our partnerships with philanthropic foundations and our alliance with other educational resource organizations, OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to learning and empowering students and instructors to succeed.

    <section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1164193446666"><h3 data-type="title">About Biology</h3>
      <p id="import-auto-id1164231453381"><em data-effect="italics">Biology</em> is designed to cover the scope and sequence requirements of a typical two-semester biology course for science majors. The text provides comprehensive coverage of foundational research and core biology concepts through an evolutionary lens. <em data-effect="italics">Biology</em> includes rich features that engage students in scientific inquiry, highlight careers in the biological sciences, and offer everyday applications. The book also includes clicker questions to help students understand&#8212;and apply&#8212;key concepts. </p></section>
    <section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1164197739219"><h3 data-type="title">Coverage and Scope</h3>
      <p id="import-auto-id1164221149313">In developing <em data-effect="italics">Biology</em>, we listened to hundreds of General Biology instructors who readily provided feedback about their courses, students, challenges, and hopes for innovation. The expense of textbooks and related items did prove to be a barrier to learning.  But more importantly, these teachers suggested improvements for the textbook, which would ultimately lead to more meaningful and memorable learning experiences for students.  </p><p id="import-auto-id1164201876325">The result is a book that addresses a core organizational reality of the course and its materials&#8212;the sheer breadth of the topical coverage.  We provide a thorough treatment of biology&#8217;s foundational concepts while condensing selected topics in response to the market&#8217;s request for a textbook with a scope that is manageable for instructors and students alike. We also strive to make biology, as a discipline, interesting and accessible to students. In addition to a comprehensive coverage of core concepts and foundational research, we have incorporated features that draw learners into the discipline in meaningful ways.  </p><p id="import-auto-id1164185871638">The pedagogical choices, chapter arrangements, and learning objective fulfillment were developed and vetted with the feedback of another one hundred reviewers, who thoroughly read the material and offered detailed critical commentary. </p>
