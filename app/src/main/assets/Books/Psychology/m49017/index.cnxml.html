  <p id="fs-idm48059152">Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for example, to human
    physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues related to the mind generally
    did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two men, working in the 19th century, are generally credited
    as being the founders of psychology as a science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. Their names
    were Wilhelm Wundt and William James. This section will provide an overview of the shifts in paradigms that have influenced
    psychology from Wundt and James through today.</p>

    <h3 data-type="title">WUNDT AND STRUCTURALISM</h3>
    <p id="fs-idm61487312">Wilhelm
      <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Wundt</span> (1832&#8211;1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a psychologist.
      His famous book entitled
      <em data-effect="italics">Principles of Physiological Psychology</em> was published in 1873. Wundt viewed psychology as a scientific study of
      conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology was to identify components of consciousness and how
      those components combined to result in our conscious experience. Wundt used
      <span data-type="term">introspection</span> (he called it &#8220;internal perception&#8221;), a process by which someone examines their own
      conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other aspect of nature that a scientist
      observed. Wundt&#8217;s version of introspection used only very specific experimental conditions in which an external
      stimulus was designed to produce a scientifically observable (repeatable) experience of the mind (Danziger, 1980).
      The first stringent requirement was the use of &#8220;trained&#8221; or practiced observers, who could immediately
      observe and report a reaction. The second requirement was the use of repeatable stimuli that always produced the same
      experience in the subject and allowed the subject to expect and thus be fully attentive to the inner reaction. These
      experimental requirements were put in place to eliminate &#8220;interpretation&#8221; in the reporting of internal
      experiences and to counter the argument that there is no way to know that an individual is observing their mind or
      consciousness accurately, since it cannot be seen by any other person. This attempt to understand the structure or
      characteristics of the mind was known as
      <span data-type="term">structuralism</span>. Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (
      <a href="#CNX_Psych_01_02_Wundt"
        class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A subject,
      sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or sound. The subject&#8217;s
      reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the time to reaction. Wundt could
      measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas &amp; Ferrand, 1999).</p>

    <p id="eip-586">However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly subjective,
      and there was very little agreement between individuals. As a result, structuralism fell out of favor with the passing
      of Wundt&#8217;s student, Edward Titchener, in 1927 (Gordon, 1995).</p>

    <h3 data-type="title">JAMES AND FUNCTIONALISM</h3>
    <p id="fs-idp35147312">William
      <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">James</span> (1842&#8211;1910) was the first American psychologist who espoused a different perspective on how psychology
      should operate (
      <a href="#CNX_Psych_01_02_James" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). James was introduced to Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution by natural selection and accepted it as an
      explanation of an organism&#8217;s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to
      organisms that are adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism
      has a function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
      saw it, psychology&#8217;s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
      was known as
      <span data-type="term">functionalism</span>. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its environment. Functionalism
      has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in the operation of the whole mind rather
      than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like Wundt, James believed that introspection
      could serve as one means by which someone might study mental activities, but James also relied on more objective measures,
      including the use of various recording devices, and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy
      and physiology (Gordon, 1995).</p>

    <h3 data-type="title">FREUD AND PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY</h3>
    <p id="fs-idp64602112">Perhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology&#8217;s history was Sigmund
      <span data-type="term"
        class="no-emphasis">Freud</span> (
      <a href="#CNX_Psych_01_02_Freud" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Freud (1856&#8211;1939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from &#8220;hysteria&#8221;
      and neurosis. Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety of symptoms,
      including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physical cause. Freud theorized
      that many of his patients&#8217; problems arose from the unconscious mind. In Freud&#8217;s view, the unconscious mind
      was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness. Gaining access to the unconscious, then, was
      crucial to the successful resolution of the patient&#8217;s problems. According to Freud, the unconscious mind could
      be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that came to people&#8217;s minds, and through
      seemingly innocent slips of the tongue.
      <span data-type="term">Psychoanalytic theory</span> focuses on the role of a person&#8217;s unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences,
      and this particular perspective dominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005).</p>
    <figure id="CNX_Psych_01_02_Freud">
      <figcaption>(a) Sigmund Freud was a highly influential figure in the history of psychology. (b) One of his many books,
        <em data-effect="italics">A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis</em>, shared his ideas about psychoanalytical therapy; it was published

      </span>

    </figure>
    <p id="fs-idm50839632">Freud&#8217;s ideas were influential, and you will learn more about them when you study lifespan development, personality,
      and therapy. For instance, many therapists believe strongly in the unconscious and the impact of early childhood experiences
      on the rest of a person&#8217;s life. The method of psychoanalysis, which involves the patient talking about their
      experiences and selves, while not invented by Freud, was certainly popularized by him and is still used today. Many
      of Freud&#8217;s other ideas, however, are controversial. Drew Westen (1998) argues that many of the criticisms of
      Freud&#8217;s ideas are misplaced, in that they attack his older ideas without taking into account later writings.
      Westen also argues that critics fail to consider the success of the broad ideas that Freud introduced or developed,
      such as the importance of childhood experiences in adult motivations, the role of unconscious versus conscious motivations
      in driving our behavior, the fact that motivations can cause conflicts that affect behavior, the effects of mental
      representations of ourselves and others in guiding our interactions, and the development of personality over time.
      Westen identifies subsequent research support for all of these ideas.</p>
    <p id="fs-idm2800432">More modern iterations of Freud&#8217;s clinical approach have been empirically demonstrated to be effective (Knekt et
      al., 2008; Shedler, 2010). Some current practices in psychotherapy involve examining unconscious aspects of the self
      and relationships, often through the relationship between the therapist and the client. Freud&#8217;s historical significance
      and contributions to clinical practice merit his inclusion in a discussion of the historical movements within psychology.</p>

    <h3 data-type="title">WERTHEIMER, KOFFKA, K&#214;HLER, AND GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY</h3>
    <p id="fs-idp12734720">Max Wertheimer (1880&#8211;1943), Kurt Koffka (1886&#8211;1941), and Wolfgang K&#246;hler (1887&#8211;1967) were three
      German psychologists who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century to escape Nazi Germany. These men
      are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles. The word
      <span data-type="term"
        class="no-emphasis">Gestalt</span> roughly translates to &#8220;whole;&#8221; a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact
      that although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts, how those parts relate to each other as
      a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception. For example, a song may be made up of individual notes
      played by different instruments, but the real nature of the song is perceived in the combinations of these notes as
      they form the melody, rhythm, and harmony. In many ways, this particular perspective would have directly contradicted
      Wundt&#8217;s ideas of structuralism (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005).</p>
    <p id="fs-idm75121728">Unfortunately, in moving to the United States, these men were forced to abandon much of their work and were unable to
      continue to conduct research on a large scale. These factors along with the rise of behaviorism (described next) in
      the United States prevented principles of Gestalt psychology from being as influential in the United States as they
      had been in their native Germany (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005). Despite these issues, several Gestalt principles are
      still very influential today. Considering the human individual as a whole rather than as a sum of individually measured
      parts became an important foundation in humanistic theory late in the century. The ideas of Gestalt have continued
      to influence research on sensation and perception.</p>
    <p id="fs-idm123393392">Structuralism, Freud, and the Gestalt psychologists were all concerned in one way or another with describing and understanding
      inner experience. But other researchers had concerns that inner experience could be a legitimate subject of scientific
      inquiry and chose instead to exclusively study behavior, the objectively observable outcome of mental processes.</p>

    <h3 data-type="title">PAVLOV, WATSON, SKINNER, AND BEHAVIORISM</h3>
    <p id="fs-idp58395184">Early work in the field of behavior was conducted by the Russian physiologist Ivan
      <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Pavlov</span> (1849&#8211;1936). Pavlov studied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex, in which an
      animal or human produced a reflex (unconscious) response to a stimulus and, over time, was conditioned to produce the
      response to a different stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus. The reflex Pavlov worked
      with was salivation in response to the presence of food. The salivation reflex could be elicited using a second stimulus,
      such as a specific sound, that was presented in association with the initial food stimulus several times. Once the
      response to the second stimulus was &#8220;learned,&#8221; the food stimulus could be omitted. Pavlov&#8217;s &#8220;classical
      conditioning&#8221; is only one form of learning behavior studied by behaviorists.</p>
    <p id="fs-idm90863904">John B.
      <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Watson</span> (1878&#8211;1958) was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred during the
      early 20th century at Johns Hopkins University (
      <a href="#CNX_Psych_01_02_Watson" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). While Wundt and James were concerned with understanding conscious experience, Watson thought that the
      study of consciousness was flawed. Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible, Watson preferred
      to focus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control. Watson was a major proponent
      of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior, and this approach of observing and controlling behavior
      came to be known as
      <span data-type="term">behaviorism</span>. A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities
      of the organism. Behaviorism commonly used animals in experiments under the assumption that what was learned using
      animal models could, to some degree, be applied to human behavior. Indeed, Tolman (1938) stated, &#8220;I believe that
      everything important in psychology (except &#8230; such matters as involve society and words) can be investigated in
      essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice-point
      in a maze.&#8221;</p>

    <p id="eip-683">Behaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades, and its influence can still be felt today (Thorne
      &amp; Henley, 2005). Behaviorism is largely responsible for establishing psychology as a scientific discipline through
      its objective methods and especially experimentation. In addition, it is used in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral
      therapy. Behavior modification is commonly used in classroom settings. Behaviorism has also led to research on environmental
      influences on human behavior.</p>
    <p id="fs-idm92162944">B. F.
      <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Skinner</span> (1904&#8211;1990) was an American psychologist (
      <a href="#CNX_Psych_01_02_Skinner" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Like Watson, Skinner was a behaviorist, and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences.
      Therefore, Skinner spoke of reinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior. As a part of his research,
      Skinner developed a chamber that allowed the careful study of the principles of modifying behavior through reinforcement
      and punishment. This device, known as an operant conditioning chamber (or more familiarly, a Skinner box), has remained
      a crucial resource for researchers studying behavior (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005).</p>

      such as a lever or a button. When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver a positive reinforcement
      of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise) or a token conditioner (such as a light) that is correlated
      with either the positive reinforcement or punishment.</p>
    <p id="fs-idp7000048">Skinner&#8217;s focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in psychology
      that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite this, conditioned learning is
      still used in human behavioral modification. Skinner&#8217;s two widely read and controversial popular science books
      about the value of operant conditioning for creating happier lives remain as thought-provoking arguments for his approach
      (Greengrass, 2004).</p>

    <h3 data-type="title">MASLOW, ROGERS, AND HUMANISM</h3>
    <p id="fs-idp56995824">During the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis. However, some psychologists
      were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so influential to the field. They objected to
      the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the unconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism,
      or simplifying nature, of behaviorism. Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior
      as entirely determined by a combination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas
      that emphasized personal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for &#8220;good&#8221; as important for
      our self-concept and our behavior. Thus, humanism emerged.
      <span data-type="term">Humanism</span> is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans.
      Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O&#8217;Hara, n.d.).</p>
    <p id="fs-idm47239952">Abraham
      <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Maslow</span> (1908&#8211;1970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of human needs
      in motivating behavior (
      <a href="#CNX_Psych_01_02_Maslow" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter, a brief overview will be provided
      here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for survival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level
      needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate behavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to
      self-actualization, a process by which we achieve our full potential. Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects
      of human nature that are characteristic of the humanistic perspective is evident (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005). Humanistic
      psychologists rejected, on principle, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition
      of the physical and biological sciences, because it missed the &#8220;whole&#8221; human being. Beginning with Maslow
      and Rogers, there was an insistence on a humanistic research program. This program has been largely qualitative (not
      measurement-based), but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology, including
      research on happiness, self-concept, meditation, and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy (Friedman, 2008).</p>

      plays an important role in interpreting what conscious behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered
      therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to
      display three features to maximize the effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness,
      and empathy. Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they
      are, no matter what he or she might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable
      of dealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005).</p>

    <h3 data-type="title">THE COGNITIVE REVOLUTION</h3>
    <p id="fs-idp101701360">Behaviorism&#8217;s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists&#8217; attention
      away from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected attention
      to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new disciplinary perspectives
      in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas revived interest in the mind as a
      focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known as the cognitive revolution (Miller,
      2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled
      <em data-effect="italics">Cognitive Psychology</em>, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne &amp;
      Henley, 2005).</p>
    <p id="fs-idm121942976">Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very influential
      in the early days of this movement (
      <a href="#CNX_Psych_01_02_Chomsky" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Chomsky (1928&#8211;), an American linguist, was dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had
      had on psychology. He believed that psychology&#8217;s focus on behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to
      re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding
      behavior (Miller, 2003).</p>

    <p id="fs-idm66647504">European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and thus, the cognitive
      revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and their American counterparts.
      Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields, like anthropology, linguistics, computer
      science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences,
      and the influence and prominence of this particular perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).</p>

      <div data-type="title">Feminist Psychology</div>
      <p id="fs-idm100806480">The science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant influence
        of Western, white, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology developed with the
        biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of society that were not
        white or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other countries, and individuals
        with sexual orientations other than heterosexual had difficulties entering the field of psychology and therefore
        influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of white, male psychologists, who were not immune
        to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the
        science of psychology was largely a &#8220;womanless&#8221; psychology (Crawford &amp; Marecek, 1989), meaning that
        few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental
        subjects of psychology were mostly men, which resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on
        psychology and that women were not of sufficient interest to study.</p>
      <p id="fs-idm65561840">An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in psychology
        by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists for constructing
        the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful experimental tests to verify
        any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by prominent psychologists in the
        1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: &#8220;. . . we must start with the realization that, as much as women
        want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be womanly companions of men and to be mothers.&#8221;
        Weisstein&#8217;s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent development of a feminist psychology that attempted
        to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our knowledge of the psychology of women and, indeed, of both
        genders.</p>
      <p id="fs-idp5166624">Crawford &amp; Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
        psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
        studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the scientific
        approach to knowledge.</p>

    <h3 data-type="title">MULTICULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY</h3>
    <p id="fs-idm171769824">Culture has important impacts on individuals and social psychology, yet the effects of
      <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">culture</span> on psychology are under-studied. There is a risk that psychological theories and data derived from white,
      American settings could be assumed to apply to individuals and social groups from other cultures and this is unlikely
      to be true (Betancourt &amp; L&#243;pez, 1993). One weakness in the field of cross-cultural psychology is that in looking
      for differences in psychological attributes across cultures, there remains a need to go beyond simple descriptive statistics
      (Betancourt &amp; L&#243;pez, 1993). In this sense, it has remained a descriptive science, rather than one seeking
      to determine cause and effect. For example, a study of characteristics of individuals seeking treatment for a binge
      eating disorder in Hispanic American, African American, and Caucasian American individuals found significant differences
      between groups (Franko et al., 2012). The study concluded that results from studying any one of the groups could not
      be extended to the other groups, and yet potential causes of the differences were not measured.</p>
    <p id="fs-idm126171232">This history of multicultural psychology in the United States is a long one. The role of African American psychologists
      in researching the cultural differences between African American individual and social psychology is but one example.
      In 1920, Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United States. Sumner established
      a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a new generation of African American
      psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early African American psychologists (and a general
      focus of much work in first half of the 20th century in psychology in the United States) was dedicated to testing and
      intelligence testing in particular (Black et al., 2004). That emphasis has continued, particularly because of the importance
      of testing in determining opportunities for children, but other areas of exploration in African-American psychology
      research include learning style, sense of community and belonging, and spiritualism (Black et al., 2004).</p>
    <p id="fs-idm80857312">The American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional psychologists that
      facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic groups or cultures have the
      most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations provide an opportunity for the growth
      of research on the impact of culture on individual and social psychology.</p>

    <h3 data-type="title">Summary</h3>
    <p id="fs-idm127516896">Before the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However, both Wundt and
      James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist, which meant he believed
      that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into its component parts. He thought
      this was best accomplished by introspection.</p>
    <p id="fs-idm69010720">William James was the first American psychologist, and he was a proponent of functionalism. This particular perspective
      focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism&#8217;s environment. Like Wundt, James
      also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also incorporated more objective measures as well.</p>
    <p id="fs-idm71138000">Sigmund Freud believed that understanding the unconscious mind was absolutely critical to understand conscious behavior.
      This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various hysterias and neuroses. Freud relied
      on dream analysis, slips of the tongue, and free association as means to access the unconscious. Psychoanalytic theory
      remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for several decades.</p>
    <p id="fs-idp10521856">Gestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an individual and his
      experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and K&#246;hler immigrated to the United States.
      Although they left their laboratories and their research behind, they did introduce America to Gestalt ideas. Some
      of the principles of Gestalt psychology are still very influential in the study of sensation and perception.</p>
    <p id="fs-idm30223728">One of the most influential schools of thought within psychology&#8217;s history was behaviorism. Behaviorism focused
      on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing the importance of unobservable
      mental processes. John Watson is often considered the father of behaviorism, and B. F. Skinner&#8217;s contributions
      to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot be underestimated.</p>
    <p id="fs-idm65457616">As behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to become dissatisfied
      with psychology&#8217;s picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within psychology began to take hold.
      Humanism focuses on the potential of all people for good. Both Maslow and Rogers were influential in shaping humanistic
      psychology.</p>
    <p id="fs-idm89388736">During the 1950s, the landscape of psychology began to change. A science of behavior began to shift back to its roots
      of focus on mental processes. The emergence of neuroscience and computer science aided this transition. Ultimately,
      the cognitive revolution took hold, and people came to realize that cognition was crucial to a true appreciation and
      understanding of behavior.</p>
