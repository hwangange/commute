 <para id="eip-818">Visual and auditory stimuli both occur in the form of waves. Although the two stimuli are very different in terms of composition, wave forms share similar characteristics that are especially important to our visual and auditory perceptions. In this section, we describe the physical properties of the waves as well as the perceptual experiences associated with them.</para><section id="fs-idm163523312">

    <title>LIGHT WAVES</title>
    <para id="fs-idm58596496">The <term>visible spectrum</term> is the portion of the larger <term>electromagnetic spectrum</term> that we can see. As <link target-id="Figure_05_02_Spectrum"/> shows, the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all of the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our environment and includes gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet light, visible light, infrared light, microwaves, and radio waves. The visible spectrum in humans is associated with wavelengths that range from 380 to 740 nmâ€”a very small distance, since a nanometer (nm) is one billionth of a meter. Other species can detect other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. For instance, honeybees can see light in the ultraviolet range (Wakakuwa, Stavenga, &amp; Arikawa, 2007), and some snakes can detect infrared radiation in addition to more traditional visual light cues (Chen, Deng, Brauth, Ding, &amp; Tang, 2012; Hartline, Kass, &amp; Loop, 1978).</para>

    <title>SOUND WAVES</title>
    <para id="fs-idm2640704">Like light waves, the physical properties of sound waves are associated with various aspects of our perception of sound. The frequency of a sound wave is associated with our perception of that soundâ€™s <term>pitch</term>. High-frequency sound waves are perceived as high-pitched sounds, while low-frequency sound waves are perceived as low-pitched sounds. The audible range of sound frequencies is between 20 and 20000 Hz, with greatest sensitivity to those frequencies that fall in the middle of this range.</para> 
    <para id="fs-idp89513280">As was the case with the visible spectrum, other species show differences in their audible ranges. For instance, chickens have a very limited audible range, from 125 to 2000 Hz. Mice have an audible range from 1000 to 91000 Hz, and the beluga whaleâ€™s audible range is from 1000 to 123000 Hz. Our pet dogs and cats have audible ranges of about 70â€“45000 Hz and 45â€“64000 Hz, respectively (Strain, 2003).</para>
    <para id="fs-idp9306416">The loudness of a given sound is closely associated with the amplitude of the sound wave. Higher amplitudes are associated with louder sounds. Loudness is measured in terms of <term>decibels (dB)</term>, a logarithmic unit of sound intensity. A typical conversation would correlate with 60 dB; a rock concert might check in at 120 dB (<link target-id="Figure_05_02_AudRange"/>). A whisper 5 feet away or rustling leaves are at the low end of our hearing range; sounds like a window air conditioner, a normal conversation, and even heavy traffic or a vacuum cleaner are within a tolerable range. However, there is the potential for hearing damage from about 80 dB to 130 dB: These are sounds of a food processor, power lawnmower, heavy truck (25 feet away), subway train (20 feet away), live rock music, and a jackhammer. The threshold for pain is about 130 dB, a jet plane taking off or a revolver firing at close range (Dunkle, 1982).</para>
    <figure id="Figure_05_02_AudRange">
      <media id="fs-idm27788608" alt="This illustration has a vertical bar in the middle labeled Decibels (dB) numbered 0 to 140 in intervals of 20 from the bottom to the top. To the left of the bar, the &#x201C;sound intensity&#x201D; of different sounds is labeled: &#x201C;Hearing threshold&#x201D; is 0; &#x201C;Whisper&#x201D; is 30, &#x201C;soft music&#x201D; is 40, &#x201C;Risk of hearing loss&#x201D; is 110, &#x201C;pain threshold&#x201D; is 130, and &#x201C;harmful&#x201D; is 140. To the right of the bar are photographs depicting &#x201C;common sound&#x201D;: At 20 decibels is a picture of rustling leaves; At 60 is two people talking, at 80 is a car, at 90 is a food processor, at 120 is a music concert, and at 130 are jets.">

    <para id="fs-idm60185952">Although wave amplitude is generally associated with loudness, there is some interaction between frequency and amplitude in our perception of loudness within the audible range. For example, a 10 Hz sound wave is inaudible no matter the amplitude of the wave. A 1000 Hz sound wave, on the other hand, would vary dramatically in terms of perceived loudness as the amplitude of the wave increased.</para>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <para id="fs-idm21712160">Both light and sound can be described in terms of wave forms with physical characteristics like amplitude, wavelength, and timbre. Wavelength and frequency are inversely related so that longer waves have lower frequencies, and shorter waves have higher frequencies. In the visual system, a light waveâ€™s wavelength is generally associated with color, and its amplitude is associated with brightness. In the auditory system, a soundâ€™s frequency is associated with pitch, and its amplitude is associated with loudness.</para>
