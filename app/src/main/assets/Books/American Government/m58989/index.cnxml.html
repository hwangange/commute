<p id="fs-id1163758499938">While attitudes and beliefs are slow to change, ideology can be influenced by events. A student might leave college with a liberal ideology but become more conservative as she ages. A first-year teacher may view unions with suspicion based on second-hand information but change his mind after reading newsletters and attending union meetings. These shifts may change the way citizens vote and the answers they give in polls. For this reason, political scientists often study when and why such changes in ideology happen, and how they influence our opinions about government and politicians.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1163756250664"><h3 data-type="title">EXPERIENCES THAT AFFECT PUBLIC OPINION</h3>
<p id="fs-id1163758560210">Ideological shifts are more likely to occur if a voter&#8217;s ideology is only weakly supported by his or her beliefs. Citizens can also hold beliefs or opinions that are contrary or conflicting, especially if their knowledge of an issue or candidate is limited. And having limited information makes it easier for them to abandon an opinion. Finally, citizens&#8217; opinions will change as they grow older and separate from family.<a href="#rf-43" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-43">Michael S. Lewis-Beck, William G. Jacoby, Helmut Norpoth, and Herbert F. Weisberg. 2008. <em data-effect="italics">American Vote Revisited</em>. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1163758494737">Citizens use two methods to form an opinion about an issue or candidate. The first is to rely on <span data-type="term">heuristics</span>, shortcuts or rules of thumb (cues) for decision making. Political party membership is one of the most common heuristics in voting. Many voters join a political party whose platform aligns most closely with their political beliefs, and voting for a candidate from that party simply makes sense. A Republican candidate will likely espouse conservative beliefs, such as smaller government and lower taxes, that are often more appealing to a Republican voter. Studies have shown that up to half of voters make decisions using their political party identification, or party ID, especially in races where information about candidates is scarce.<a href="#rf-44" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-44">Samuel Popkin. 2008. <em data-effect="italics">The Reasoning Voter: Communication and Persuasion in Presidential Campaigns</em>. Chicago: University Of Chicago Press. Michael S. Lewis-Beck, William G. Jacoby, Helmut Norpoth, and Herbert F. Weisberg. 2008. <em data-effect="italics">American Vote Revisited</em>. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1163758408436">In non-partisan and some local elections, where candidates are not permitted to list their party identifications, voters may have to rely on a candidate&#8217;s background or job description to form a quick opinion of a candidate&#8217;s suitability. A candidate for judge may list &#8220;criminal prosecutor&#8221; as current employment, leaving the voter to determine whether a prosecutor would make a good judge.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758473687">The second method is to do research, learning background information before making a decision. Candidates, parties, and campaigns put out a large array of information to sway potential voters, and the media provide wide coverage, all of which is readily available online and elsewhere. But many voters are unwilling to spend the necessary time to research and instead vote with incomplete information.<a href="#rf-45" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-45">Scott Ashworth, and Ethan Bueno De Mesquita. 2014. &#8220;Is Voter Competence Good for Voters? Information, Rationality, and Democratic Performance.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">American Political Science Review</em> 108 (3): 565&#8211;587.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1163758485248">Gender, race, socio-economic status, and interest-group affiliation also serve as heuristics for decision making. Voters may assume female candidates have a stronger understanding about social issues relevant to women. Business owners may prefer to vote for a candidate with a college degree who has worked in business rather than a career politician. Other voters may look to see which candidate is endorsed by the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">National Organization of Women</span> (NOW), because NOW&#8217;s endorsement will ensure the candidate supports abortion rights.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758506614">Opinions based on heuristics rather than research are more likely to change when the cue changes. If a voter begins listening to a new source of information or moves to a new town, the influences and cues he or she meets will change. Even if the voter is diligently looking for information to make an informed decision, demographic cues matter. Age, gender, race, and socio-economic status will shape our opinions because they are a part of our everyday reality, and they become part of our barometer on whether a leader or government is performing well.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758716130">A look at the 2012 presidential election shows how the opinions of different demographic groups vary (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_06_03_2012Demo" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). For instance, 55 percent of women voted for Barack Obama and 52 percent of men voted for Mitt Romney. Age mattered as well&#8212;60 percent of voters under thirty voted for Obama, whereas 56 percent of those over sixty-five voted for Romney. Racial groups also varied in their support of the candidates. Ninety-three percent of African Americans and 71 percent of Hispanics voted for Obama instead of Romney.<a href="#rf-46" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-46">Gallup. 2015. &#8220;U.S. Presidential Election Center.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Gallup</em>. June 6, 2015. http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/US-Presidential-Election-Center.aspx (February 18, 2016).</div></a> These demographic effects are likely to be strong because of shared experiences, concerns, and ideas. Citizens who are comfortable with one another will talk more and share opinions, leading to more opportunities to influence or reinforce one another.</p>

<p id="fs-id1163756144873">The political culture of a state can also have an effect on ideology and opinion. In the 1960s, Daniel Elazar researched interviews, voting data, newspapers, and politicians&#8217; speeches. He determined that states had unique cultures and that different state governments instilled different attitudes and beliefs in their citizens, creating <span data-type="term">political culture</span><strong data-effect="bold">s</strong>. Some states value tradition, and their laws try to maintain longstanding beliefs. Other states believe government should help people and therefore create large bureaucracies that provide benefits to assist citizens. Some political cultures stress citizen involvement whereas others try to exclude participation by the masses.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758378052">State political cultures can affect the ideology and opinions of those who live in or move to them. For example, opinions about gun ownership and rights vary from state to state. Polls show that 61 percent of all Californians, regardless of ideology or political party, stated there should be more controls on who owns guns.<a href="#rf-47" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-47">Josh Richman, &#8220;Field Poll: California Voters Favor Gun Controls Over Protecting Second Amendment Rights,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">San Jose Mercury News</em>, 26 February 2013.</div></a> In contrast, in Texas, support for the right to carry a weapon is high. Fifty percent of self-identified Democrats&#8212;who typically prefer more controls on guns rather than fewer&#8212;said Texans should be allowed to carry a concealed weapon if they have a permit.<a href="#rf-48" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-48">UT Austin. 2015. &#8220;Agreement with Concealed Carry Laws.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">UT Austin Texas Politics Project</em>. February 2015. http://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/agreement-concealed-carry-laws-february-2015#party-id (February 18, 2016).</div></a> In this case, state culture may have affected citizens&#8217; feelings about the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Second Amendment</span> and moved them away from the expected ideological beliefs.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758648579">The workplace can directly or indirectly affect opinions about policies, social issues, and political leaders by socializing employees through shared experiences. People who work in education, for example, are often surrounded by others with high levels of education. Their concerns will be specific to the education sector and different from those in other workplaces. Frequent association with colleagues can align a person&#8217;s thinking with theirs.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758392288">Workplace groups such as professional organizations or unions can also influence opinions. These organizations provide members with specific information about issues important to them and lobby on their behalf in an effort to better work environments, increase pay, or enhance shared governance. They may also pressure members to vote for particular candidates or initiatives they believe will help promote the organization&#8217;s goals. For example, teachers&#8217; unions often support the Democratic Party because it has historically supported increased funding to public schools and universities.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758510730">Important political opinion leaders, or <span data-type="term">political elite</span><strong data-effect="bold">s</strong>, also shape public opinion, usually by serving as short-term cues that help voters pay closer attention to a political debate and make decisions about it. Through a talk program or opinion column, the elite commentator tells people when and how to react to a current problem or issue. Millennials and members of Generation X (currently ages 38&#8211;53) long used Jon Stewart of <em data-effect="italics">The Daily Show</em> and later Stephen Colbert of <em data-effect="italics">The Colbert Report</em> as shortcuts to becoming informed about current events. In the same way, older generations trusted Tom Brokaw and <em data-effect="italics">60 Minutes</em>.</p><p id="fs-id1163758325367">Because an elite source can pick and choose the information and advice to provide, the door is open to covert influence if this source is not credible or honest. Voters must be able to trust the quality of the information. When elites lose credibility, they lose their audience. News agencies are aware of the relationship between citizens and elites, which is why news anchors for major networks are carefully chosen. When Brian <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Williams</span> of NBC was accused of lying about his experiences in Iraq and New Orleans, he was suspended pending an investigation. Williams later admitted to several misstatements and apologized to the public, and he was removed from <em data-effect="italics">The</em> <em data-effect="italics">Nightly News</em>.<a href="#rf-49" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-49">Stephen Battaglio, &#8220;Brian Williams Will Leave &#8216;NBC Nightly News&#8217; and Join MSNBC,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">LA Times</em>, 18 June 2015.</div></a></p>

<p id="fs-id1163758432320">What <em data-effect="italics">do</em> Americans think about their political system, policies, and institutions? Public opinion has not been consistent over the years. It fluctuates based on the times and events, and on the people holding major office (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_06_03_ChangeOp" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Sometimes a majority of the public express similar ideas, but many times not. Where, then, does the public agree and disagree? Let&#8217;s look at the two-party system, and then at opinions about public policy, economic policy, and social policy.</p>
<figure id="OSC_AmGov_06_03_ChangeOp"><figcaption>Public opinion may change significantly over time. Two issues that have undergone dramatic shifts in public opinion during the last twenty years are same-sex marriage and immigration.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-id1163758318993">The United States is traditionally a two-party system. Only Democrats and Republicans regularly win the presidency and, with few exceptions, seats in Congress. The majority of voters cast ballots only for Republicans and Democrats, even when third parties are represented on the ballot. Yet, citizens say they are frustrated with the current party system. Only 32 percent identify themselves as Democrats and only 23 percent as Republicans. Democratic membership has stayed relatively the same, but the Republican Party has lost about 6 percent of its membership over the last ten years, whereas the number of self-identified independents has grown from 30 percent in 2004 to 39 percent in 2014.<a href="#rf-50" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-50">Pew Research Center. 2015. &#8220;Party Identification Trends, 1992&#8211;2014.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Pew Research Center</em>.

<p id="fs-id1163758514582">Some of these changes in party allegiance may be due to generational and cultural shifts. Millennials and Generation Xers are more likely to support the Democratic Party than the Republican Party. In recent polling, 51 percent of Millennials and 49 percent of Generation Xers stated they did, whereas only 35 percent and 38 percent, respectively, supported the Republican Party. Baby Boomers (currently aged 54&#8211;72) are slightly less likely than the other groups to support the Democratic Party; only 47 percent reported doing so. The Silent Generation (born in the 1920s to early 1940s) is the only cohort whose members state they support the Republican Party as a majority.<a href="#rf-52" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-52">Pew Research Center. 2015. &#8220;A Different Look at Generations and Partisanship.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Pew Research Center</em>.

Almost 7 percent of the population now identifies as biracial or multiracial, and that percentage is likely to grow. The number of citizens identifying as both African American and white doubled between 2000 and 2010, whereas the number of citizens identifying as both Asian American and white grew by 87 percent. The Pew study found that only 37 percent of multiracial adults favored the Republican Party, while 57 percent favored the Democratic Party.<a href="#rf-53" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-53">Pew Research Center. 2015. &#8220;Multiracial in America.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Pew Research Center</em>.

<p id="fs-id1163758546134">At its heart, politics is about dividing scarce resources fairly and balancing liberties and rights. Public policy often becomes messy as politicians struggle to fix problems with the nation&#8217;s limited budget while catering to numerous opinions about how best to do so. While the public often remains quiet, simply answering public opinion polls or dutifully casting their votes on Election Day, occasionally citizens weigh in more audibly by protesting or lobbying.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758408905">Some policy decisions are made without public input if they preserve the way money is allocated or defer to policies already in place. But policies that directly affect personal economics, such as tax policy, may cause a public backlash, and those that affect civil liberties or closely held beliefs may cause even more public upheaval. Policies that break new ground similarly stir public opinion and introduce change that some find difficult. The acceptance of same-sex marriage, for example, pitted those who sought to preserve their religious beliefs against those who sought to be treated equally under the law.</p>

<p id="fs-id1163758841198">When asked about government spending, the public was more united in wanting policy to be fiscally responsible without raising taxes.

<p id="fs-id1163758432123">In general, programs that benefit only some Americans or have unclear benefits cause more controversy and discussion when the economy slows. Few citizens directly benefit from welfare and business subsidies, so it is not surprising that 52 percent of respondents wanted to cut back on welfare and 57 percent wanted to cut back business subsidies. While some farm subsidies decrease the price of food items, like milk and corn, citizens may not be aware of how these subsidies affect the price of goods at the grocery store, perhaps explaining why 44 percent of respondents stated they would prefer to cut back on agricultural subsidies.<a href="#rf-57" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-57">Harris Poll Online. 2012. &#8220;Cutting Government Spending May be Popular But Majorities of the Public Oppose Cuts in Many Big Ticket Items in the Budget.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Harris Poll Online</em>.

<p id="fs-id1163758508029">Social policy consists of government&#8217;s attempts to regulate public behavior in the service of a better society. To accomplish this, government must achieve the difficult task of balancing the rights and liberties of citizens. A person&#8217;s right to privacy, for example, might need to be limited if another person is in danger. But to what extent should the government intrude in the private lives of its citizens? In a recent survey, 54 percent of respondents believed the U.S. government was too involved in trying to deal with issues of morality.<a href="#rf-58" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-58">Pew Research Center. 2011. &#8220;Domestic Issues and Social Policy.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Pew Research Center</em>.

<p id="fs-id1163758405558">Abortion is a social policy issue that has caused controversy for nearly a century. One segment of the population wants to protect the rights of the unborn child. Another wants to protect the bodily autonomy of women and the right to privacy between a patient and her doctor. The divide is visible in public opinion polls, where 51 percent of respondents said abortion should be legal in most cases and 43 percent said it should be illegal in most cases. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Affordable Care Act</span>, which increased government involvement in health care, has drawn similar controversy. In a 2015 poll, 53 percent of respondents disapproved of the act, a 9-percent increase from five years before. Much of the public&#8217;s frustration comes from the act&#8217;s mandate that individuals purchase health insurance or pay a fine (in order to create a large enough pool of insured people to reduce the overall cost of coverage), which some see as an intrusion into individual decision making.<a href="#rf-59" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-59">Pew Research Center. 2015. &#8220;Views of Health Care Law, 2010-2015.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Pew Research Center</em>.

<p id="fs-id1163758507625">Laws allowing same-sex marriage raise the question whether the government should be defining marriage and regulating private relationships in defense of personal and spousal rights.

<p id="fs-id1163758471510">Another area where social policy must balance rights and liberties is public safety. Regulation of gun ownership incites strong emotions, because it invokes the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Second Amendment</span> and state culture.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1163758519751"><h3 data-type="title">PUBLIC OPINION AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS</h3>
<p id="fs-id1163756098434">Public opinion about American institutions is measured in public approval ratings rather than in questions of choice between positions or candidates. The congressional and executive branches of government are the subject of much scrutiny and discussed daily in the media. Polling companies take daily approval polls of these two branches. The Supreme Court makes the news less frequently, and approval polls are more likely after the court has released major opinions. All three branches, however, are susceptible to swings in public approval in response to their actions and to national events. Approval ratings are generally not stable for any of the three. We next look at each in turn.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163756274518">The president is the most visible member of the U.S. government and a lightning rod for disagreement. Presidents are often blamed for the decisions of their administrations and political parties, and are held accountable for economic and foreign policy downturns. For these reasons, they can expect their approval ratings to slowly decline over time, increasing or decreasing slightly with specific events. On average, presidents enjoy a 66 percent approval rating when starting office, but it drops to 53 percent by the end of the first term. Presidents serving a second term average a beginning approval rating of 55.5 percent, which falls to 47 percent by the end of office. President Obama&#8217;s presidency followed the same trend. He entered office with a public approval rating of 67 percent, which fell to 54 percent by the third quarter, dropped to 52 percent after his reelection, and, as of the presidential election in November 2016, was at 46 percent (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_06_03_PrezAppr" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p><figure id="OSC_AmGov_06_03_PrezAppr"><figcaption>As President Obama&#8217;s ratings demonstrate, presidential approval ratings generally decline over time but may fluctuate based on specific events or policies.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-id1163758461281" data-alt="Chart shows President Obama&#8217;s job approval ratings. When his Presidency begins on January 2009, he is at around 65%.

After falling to around 40%, his approval rating begins to rise, until his reelection on November 2012 when it was at around 53%. It rises slightly, peaking around 56%, then slowly declining. When the budget crises hits in October 2013, Obama&#8217;s approval rating is around 45%, hitting a low of about 40% around 2014.

<p id="fs-id1163758533523">Events during a president&#8217;s term may spike his or her public approval ratings.

His father, George H. W. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bush</span>, had received a similar spike in approval ratings (from 58 to 89 percent) following the end of the first Persian Gulf War in 1991.<a href="#rf-65" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-65">Gallup. 2015. &#8220;Presidential Approval Ratings &#8211; George W.

<p id="fs-id1163758368787">Some presidents have had higher or lower public approval than others, though ratings are difficult to compare, because national and world events that affect presidential ratings are outside a president&#8217;s control. Several chief executives presided over failing economies or wars, whereas others had the benefit of strong economies and peace. Gallup, however, gives an average approval rating for each president across the entire period served in office. George W. Bush&#8217;s average approval rating from 2001 to 2008 was 49.4 percent. Ronald <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Reagan</span>&#8217;s from 1981 to 1988 was 52.8 percent, despite his winning all but thirteen electoral votes in his reelection bid. Bill <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Clinton</span>&#8217;s average approval from 1993 to 2000 was 55.1 percent, including the months surrounding the Monica Lewinsky scandal and his subsequent impeachment. To compare other notable presidents, John F. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Kennedy</span> averaged 70.1 percent and Richard <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nixon</span> 49 percent.<a href="#rf-68" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-68">Gallup. 2015. &#8220;Presidential Job Approval Center.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Gallup</em>.

<p id="fs-id1163758577497">Polling is one area of U.S. politics in which political practitioners and political science scholars interact. Each election cycle, political scientists help media outlets interpret polling, statistical data, and election forecasts. One particular watershed moment in this regard occurred when Professor James Stimson, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, developed his aggregated measure of public mood. This measure takes a variety of issue positions and combines them to form a general ideology about the government. According to Professor Stimson, the American electorate became more conservative in the 1970s and again in the 1990s, as demonstrated by Republican gains in Congress. With this public mood measure in mind, political scientists can explain why and when Americans allowed major policy shifts. For example, the Great Society&#8217;s expansion of welfare and social benefits occurred during the height of liberalism in the mid-1960s, while the welfare cuts and reforms of the 1990s occurred during the nation&#8217;s move toward conservatism. Tracking conservative and liberal shifts in the public&#8217;s ideology allows policy analysts to predict whether voters are likely to accept or reject major policies.</p>

</div>
<p id="fs-id1163758777555">Congress as an institution has historically received lower approval ratings than presidents, a striking result because individual senators and representatives are generally viewed favorably by their constituents. While congressional representatives almost always win reelection and are liked by their constituents back home, the institution itself is often vilified as representing everything that is wrong with politics and partisanship.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758441743">As of August 2015, public approval of Congress sat at around 20 percent.<a href="#rf-69" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-69">Gallup. 2015. &#8220;Congress and the Public.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Gallup</em>.

Like President George W. Bush, Congress experienced a short-term jump in approval ratings immediately following 9/11, likely because of the rallying effect of the terrorist attacks. Congressional approval had dropped back below 50 percent by early 2003 (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_06_03_CongrApp" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

It rises to 38% in 1981, then falls again in 1982 to 30 %. There is a slow increase to 41% in 1986, where it levels out until 1988, when it begins to drop until it reaches 30% in 1990. It rebounds slightly to 31% in 1991, but falls drastically to 20% in 1992. A sharp increase in 1993 to 25% leads to a steady increase of approval ratings until 200 when it reaches 50%.

<p id="fs-id1163758405182">While presidents are affected by foreign and domestic events, congressional approval is mainly affected by domestic events. When the economy rebounds or gas prices drop, public approval of Congress tends to go up. But when party politics within Congress becomes a domestic event, public approval falls. The passage of revenue bills has become an example of such an event, because deficits require Congress to make policy decisions before changing the budget. Deficit and debt are not new to the United States. Congress and presidents have attempted various methods of controlling debt, sometimes successfully and sometimes not. In the past three decades alone, however, several prominent examples have shown how party politics make it difficult for Congress to agree on a budget without a fight, and how these fights affect public approval.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758393303">In 1995, Democratic president Bill <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Clinton</span> and the Republican Congress hit a notable stalemate on the national budget. In this case, the Republicans had recently gained control of the House of Representatives and disagreed with Democrats and the president on how to cut spending and reduce the deficit. The government shut down twice, sending non-essential employees home for a few days in November, and then again in December and January.<a href="#rf-70" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-70">Neil Irwin, &#8220;The 1995 Shutdown, from a Budget Official&#8217;s Perspective,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Washington Post</em>, 27 September 2013.</div></a> Congressional approval fell during the event, from 35 to 30 percent.<a href="#rf-71" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-71">Gallup. 2015. &#8220;Congress and the Public.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Gallup</em>.

<p id="fs-id1163758402014">Divisions between the political parties, inside the Republican Party, and between Congress and the president became more pronounced over the next fifteen years, with the media closely covering the political strife.<a href="#rf-72" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-72">Dan Merica. 2013. &#8220;1995 and 2013: Three Differences Between the Two Shutdowns.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">CNN</em>. October 4, 2013. http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/01/politics/different-government-shutdowns/ (February 18, 2016).</div></a> In 2011, the United States reached its debt ceiling, or maximum allowed debt amount. After much debate, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Budget Control Act</span> was passed by Congress and signed by President <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Obama</span>. The act increased the debt ceiling, but it also reduced spending and created automatic cuts, called sequestrations, if further legislation did not deal with the debt by 2013. When the country reached its new debt ceiling of $16.4 trillion in 2013, short-term solutions led to Congress negotiating both the debt ceiling and the national budget at the same time. The timing raised the stakes of the budget, and Democrats and Republicans fought bitterly over the debt ceiling, budget cuts, and taxes. Inaction triggered the automatic cuts to the budget in areas like defense, the courts, and public aid. By October, approximately 800,000 federal employees had been sent home, and the government went into partial shut-down for sixteen days before Congress passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling.<a href="#rf-73" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-73">Paul Lewis, &#8220;US Shutdown Drags Into Second Day as Republicans Eye Fresh Debt Ceiling Crisis,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Guardian</em>, 2 October 2013.</div></a> The handling of these events angered Americans, who felt the political parties needed to work together to solve problems rather than play political games. During the 2011 ceiling debate, congressional approval fell from 18 to 13 percent, while in 2013, congressional approval fell to a new low of 9 percent in November.<a href="#rf-74" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-74">Gallup. 2015. &#8220;Congress and the Public.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Gallup</em>.

<p id="fs-id1163758472855">The Supreme Court generally enjoys less visibility than the other two branches of government, which leads to more stable but also less frequent polling results. Indeed, 22 percent of citizens surveyed in 2014 had never heard of Chief Justice John <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Roberts</span>, the head of the Supreme Court.<a href="#rf-75" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-75">Andrew Dugan. 2014. &#8220;Americans&#8217; Approval of Supreme Court New All-Time Low.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Gallup</em>. July 19, 2014. http://www.gallup.com/poll/163586/americans-approval-supreme-court-near-time-low.aspx (February 18, 2016).</div></a> The court is protected by the justices&#8217; non-elected, non-political positions, which gives them the appearance of integrity and helps the Supreme Court earn higher public approval ratings than presidents and Congress. To compare, between 2000 and 2010, the court&#8217;s approval rating bounced between 50 and 60 percent. During this same period, Congress had a 20 to 40 percent approval rating.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758557348">The Supreme Court&#8217;s approval rating is also less susceptible to the influence of events. Support of and opinions about the court are affected when the justices rule on highly visible cases that are of public interest or other events occur that cause citizens to become aware of the court.<a href="#rf-76" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-76">James L.

<p id="fs-id1163758591814">When citizens change their sources of information, their opinions may change. The influence of elites and workplaces, life experiences, and state political culture can all help change our opinions. Economic and social policies are likely to cause controversy if the government has to serve the needs of many different groups or balance rights and liberties, all with limited resources.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758583302">What Americans think about their government institutions shifts over time as well. Overall approval for presidents begins high and drops over time, with expected increases and decreases occurring due to domestic and international events. Approval for Congress changes more dramatically with domestic events and partisan behavior. The public has a lower opinion of Congress than of the president, and recent congressional approval levels have hovered between 10 and 20 percent. The Supreme Court has the most stable public approval ratings, possibly due to its less visible nature. But the court&#8217;s ratings can be affected by controversial decisions, such as its 2015 decisions on the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage.</p>
