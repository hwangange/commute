<p id="fs-id1171472079383">First, by officially declaring his candidacy at Liberty University, whose stated mission is to provide &#8220;a world-class education with a solid Christian foundation,&#8221; Cruz sought to demonstrate that his values were the same as those of the Christian students before him (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_07_00_Cruz" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).<a href="#rf-3" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-3">Brandie Peterson, &#8220;Election 2016: Why Ted Cruz Picked Liberty University,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">CNN</em>, 23 March 2015.</div></a> Second, the speech reminded Christians to vote. As Cruz told the students, &#8220;imagine millions of young people coming together and standing together, saying &#8216;we will stand for liberty.&#8217;&#8221;<a href="#rf-4" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-4">&#8220;Transcript: Ted Cruz&#8217;s Speech at Liberty University,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Washington Post</em>, 23 March 2015.</div></a> Like candidates for office at all levels of U.S. government, Cruz understood that campaigns must reach out to the voters and compel them to vote or the candidate will fail miserably. But what brings voters to the polls, and how do they make their voting decisions? Those are just two of the questions about voting and elections this chapter will explore.</p>
