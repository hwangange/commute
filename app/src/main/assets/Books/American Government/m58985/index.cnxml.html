<p id="fs-id1164436870354">Native Americans have long suffered the effects of segregation and discrimination imposed by the U.S. government and the larger white society. Ironically, Native Americans were not granted the full rights and protections of U.S. citizenship until long after African Americans and women were, with many having to wait until the Nationality Act of 1940 to become citizens.<a href="#rf-086" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-086">Theodore Haas. 1957. &#8220;The Legal Aspects of Indian Affairs from 1887 to 1957,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">American Academy of Political Science</em> 311, 12&#8211;22.</div></a> This was long after the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, which granted citizenship to African Americans but not, the Supreme Court decided in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis"><em data-effect="italics">Elk v.

Wilkins</em>, (1884)112 U.S. 94.</div></a> White women had been citizens of the United States since its very beginning even though they were not granted the full rights of citizenship. Furthermore, Native Americans are the only group of Americans who were forcibly removed en masse from the lands on which they and their ancestors had lived so that others could claim this land and its resources. This issue remains relevant today as can be seen in the recent protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which have led to intense confrontations between those in charge of the pipeline and Native Americans.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1164436859304"><h3 data-type="title">NATIVE AMERICANS LOSE THEIR LAND AND THEIR RIGHTS</h3>
<p id="fs-id1164436877020">From the very beginning of European settlement in North America, Native Americans were abused and exploited. Early British settlers attempted to enslave the members of various tribes, especially in the southern colonies and states.<a href="#rf-088" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-088">See Alan Gallay. 2009. <em data-effect="italics">Indian Slavery in Colonial America</em>. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.</div></a> Following the American Revolution, the U.S. government assumed responsibility for conducting negotiations with Indian tribes, all of which were designated as sovereign nations, and regulating commerce with them. Because Indians were officially regarded as citizens of other nations, they were denied U.S. citizenship.<a href="#rf-089" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-089">See James Wilson. 1998. <em data-effect="italics">The Earth Shall Weep: A History of Native America</em>. New York: Grove Press.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1164436843678">As white settlement spread westward over the course of the nineteenth century, Indian tribes were forced to move from their homelands. Although the federal government signed numerous treaties guaranteeing Indians the right to live in the places where they had traditionally farmed, hunted, or fished, land-hungry white settlers routinely violated these agreements and the federal government did little to enforce them.<a href="#rf-090" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-090">Ibid; Gloria Jahoda. 1975. <em data-effect="italics">Trail of Tears: The Story of American Indian Removal, 1813&#8211;1855</em>.<em data-effect="italics"/> New York: Henry Holt.</div></a></p>

The Cherokee in particular resisted, and in the 1820s, the state of Georgia tried numerous tactics to force them from their territory. Efforts intensified in 1829 after gold was discovered there. Wishing to remain where they were, the tribe sued the state of Georgia.<a href="#rf-092" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-092">See John Ehle. 1988. <em data-effect="italics">Trail of Tears: The Rise and Fall of the Cherokee Nation</em>.

<p id="fs-id1164436854291">By the time of the Civil War, most Indian tribes had been relocated west of the Mississippi. However, once large numbers of white Americans and European immigrants had also moved west after the Civil War, Native Americans once again found themselves displaced. They were confined to reservations, which are federal lands set aside for their use where non-Indians could not settle. Reservation land was usually poor, however, and attempts to farm or raise livestock, not traditional occupations for most western tribes anyway, often ended in failure. Unable to feed themselves, the tribes became dependent on the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bureau of Indian Affairs</span> (BIA) in Washington, DC, for support. Protestant missionaries were allowed to &#8220;adopt&#8221; various tribes, to convert them to Christianity and thus speed their assimilation. In an effort to hasten this process, Indian children were taken from their parents and sent to boarding schools, many of them run by churches, where they were forced to speak English and abandon their traditional cultures.<a href="#rf-096" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-096">&#8220;Indian Reservations,&#8221; http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/uhic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?zid=2a87fa28f20f1e66b5f663e76873fd8c&amp;action=2&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=<div data-type="newline"><br/></div>GALE|CX3401802046&amp;userGroupName=lnoca_hawken&amp;jsid=f44511ddfece4faafab082109e34a539 (April 10, 2016).</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1164436843008">In 1887, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Dawes Severalty Act</span>, another effort to assimilate Indians to white society, divided reservation lands into individual allotments. Native Americans who accepted these allotments and agreed to sever tribal ties were also given U.S. citizenship. All lands remaining after the division of reservations into allotments were offered for sale by the federal government to white farmers and ranchers. As a result, Indians swiftly lost control of reservation land.<a href="#rf-097" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-097">Ibid.</div></a> In 1898, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Curtis Act</span> dealt the final blow to Indian sovereignty by abolishing all tribal governments.<a href="#rf-098" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-098">&#8220;Curtis Act (1898),&#8221; http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=CU006 (April 10, 2016).</div></a></p>

<p id="fs-id1164436869470">As Indians were removed from their tribal lands and increasingly saw their traditional cultures being destroyed over the course of the nineteenth century, a movement to protect their rights began to grow. Sarah <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Winnemucca</span> (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_05_04_Activists" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), member of the Paiute tribe, lectured throughout the east in the 1880s in order to acquaint white audiences with the injustices suffered by the western tribes.<a href="#rf-099" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-099">See Gae Whitney Canfield. 1988. <em data-effect="italics">Sarah Winnemucca of the Northern Paiutes</em>.

In 1924, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Indian Citizenship Act</span> granted citizenship to all Native Americans born after its passage. Native Americans born before the act took effect, who had not already become citizens as a result of the Dawes Severalty Act or service in the army in World War I, had to wait until the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nationality Act</span> of 1940 to become citizens. In 1934, Congress passed the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Indian Reorganization Act</span>, which ended the division of reservation land into allotments. It returned to Native American tribes the right to institute self-government on their reservations, write constitutions, and manage their remaining lands and resources. It also provided funds for Native Americans to start their own businesses and attain a college education.<a href="#rf-100" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-100">Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (P.L. 73&#8211;383); &#8220;Indian Reservations,&#8221; http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/uhic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?zid=2a87fa28f20f1e66b5f663e76873fd8c&amp;action=2&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=<div data-type="newline"><br/></div>GALE|CX3401802046&amp;userGroupName=lnoca_hawken&amp;jsid=f44511ddfece4faafab082109e34a539 (April 10, 2016).</div></a></p>

<p id="fs-id1164436667835">Despite the Indian Reorganization Act, conditions on the reservations did not improve dramatically. Most tribes remained impoverished, and many Native Americans, despite the fact that they were now U.S. citizens, were denied the right to vote by the states in which they lived. States justified this violation of the Fifteenth Amendment by claiming that Native Americans might be U.S. citizens but were not state residents because they lived on reservations. Other states denied Native Americans voting rights if they did not pay taxes.<a href="#rf-101" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-101">Daniel McCool, Susan M. Olson, and Jennifer L. Robinson. 2007. <em data-effect="italics">Native Vote</em>. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 9, 19.</div></a> Despite states&#8217; actions, the federal government continued to uphold the rights of tribes to govern themselves. Federal concern for tribal sovereignty was part of an effort on the government&#8217;s part to end its control of, and obligations to, Indian tribes.<a href="#rf-102" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-102">&#8220;Indian Reservations,&#8221; http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/uhic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?zid=2a87fa28f20f1e66b5f663e76873fd8c&amp;action=2&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=<div data-type="newline"><br/></div>GALE|CX3401802046&amp;userGroupName=lnoca_hawken&amp;jsid=f44511ddfece4faafab082109e34a539 (April 10, 2016).</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1164436706617">In the 1960s, a modern Native American civil rights movement, inspired by the African American civil rights movement, began to grow. In 1969, a group of Native American activists from various tribes, part of a new Pan-Indian movement, took control of Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, which had once been the site of a federal prison. Attempting to strike a blow for Red Power, the power of Native Americans united by a Pan-Indian identity and demanding federal recognition of their rights, they maintained control of the island for more than a year and a half. They claimed the land as compensation for the federal government&#8217;s violation of numerous treaties and offered to pay for it with beads and trinkets. In January 1970, some of the occupiers began to leave the island. Some may have been disheartened by the accidental death of the daughter of one of the activists. In May 1970, all electricity and telephone service to the island was cut off by the federal government, and more of the occupiers began to leave. In June, the few people remaining on the island were removed by the government. Though the goals of the activists were not achieved, the occupation of Alcatraz had brought national attention to the concerns of Native American activists.<a href="#rf-103" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-103">See Troy R. Johnson. 1996. <em data-effect="italics">The Occupation of Alcatraz Island: Indian Self-Determination and the Rise of Indian Activism</em>. Urbana: University of Illinois Press.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1164436764170">In 1973, members of the <span data-type="term">American Indian Movement</span> <strong data-effect="bold">(AIM)</strong>, a more radical group than the occupiers of Alcatraz, temporarily took over the offices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, DC. The following year, members of AIM and some two hundred Oglala Lakota supporters occupied the town of Wounded Knee on the Lakota tribe&#8217;s Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, the site of an 1890 massacre of Lakota men, women, and children by the U.S. Army (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_05_04_Wknee" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Many of the Oglala were protesting the actions of their half-white tribal chieftain, who they claimed had worked too closely with the BIA. The occupiers also wished to protest the failure of the Justice Department to investigate acts of white violence against Lakota tribal members outside the bounds of the reservation.</p>
<p id="fs-id1164436869776">The occupation led to a confrontation between the Native American protestors and the FBI and U.S. Marshals. Violence erupted; two Native American activists were killed, and a marshal was shot (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_05_04_Wknee" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). After the second death, the Lakota called for an end to the occupation and negotiations began with the federal government. Two of AIM&#8217;s leaders, Russell Means and Dennis Banks, were arrested, but the case against them was later dismissed.<a href="#rf-104" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-104">Emily Chertoff, &#8220;Occupy Wounded Knee: A 71-Day Siege and a Forgotten Civil Rights Movement,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">The Atlantic</em>, 23 October 2012. http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/occupy-wounded-knee-a-71-day-siege-and-a-forgotten-civil-rights-movement/263998/.</div></a> Violence continued on the Pine Ridge Reservation for several years after the siege; the reservation had the highest per capita murder rate in the United States.

<p id="fs-id1164436870951">Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians suffered many of the same abuses as Native Americans, including loss of land and forced assimilation. Following the discovery of oil in Alaska, however, the state, in an effort to gain undisputed title to oil rich land, settled the issue of Alaska Natives&#8217; land claims with the passage of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act</span> in 1971. According to the terms of the act, Alaska Natives received 44 million acres of resource-rich land and more than $900 million in cash in exchange for relinquishing claims to ancestral lands to which the state wanted title.<a href="#rf-109" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-109">U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, &#8220;Racism&#8217;s Frontier: The Untold Story of Discrimination and Division in Alaska,&#8221; http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/sac/ak0402/ch1.htm (April 10, 2016).</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1164436750172">Native Hawaiians also lost control of their land&#8212;nearly two million acres&#8212;after the Hawaiian Islands were annexed by the United States in 1893. The indigenous population rapidly decreased in number, and white settlers tried to erase all trace of traditional Hawaiian culture. Two acts passed by Congress in 1900 and 1959, when the territory was granted statehood, returned slightly more than one million acres of federally owned land to the state of Hawaii. The state was to hold it in trust and use profits from the land to improve the condition of Native Hawaiians.<a href="#rf-110" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-110">Ryan Mielke, &#8220;Hawaiians&#8217; Years of Mistreatment,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Chicago Tribune</em>, 4 September 1999. http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-09-04/news/9909040141_1_hawaiians-oha-land-trust.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1164436758804">In September 2015, the U.S. Department of Interior, the same department that contains the Bureau of Indian Affairs, created guidelines for Native Hawaiians who wish to govern themselves in a relationship with the federal government similar to that established with Native American and Alaska Native tribes. Such a relationship would grant Native Hawaiians power to govern themselves while remaining U.S. citizens. Voting began in fall 2015 for delegates to a constitutional convention that would determine whether or not such a relationship should exist between Native Hawaiians and the federal government.<a href="#rf-111" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-111">Brittany Lyte, &#8220;Historic Election Could Return Sovereignty to Native Hawaiians,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Aljazeera America</em> 30 Oct. 2015, http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/10/30/historic-election-could-return-sovereignty-to-native-hawaiians.html.</div></a> When non-Native Hawaiians and some Native Hawaiians brought suit on the grounds that, by allowing only Native Hawaiians to vote, the process discriminated against members of other ethnic groups, a federal district court found the election to be legal. However, the Supreme Court has ordered that votes not be counted until an appeal of the lower court&#8217;s decision be heard by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.<a href="#rf-112" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-112">Chloe Fox. 2 December 2015. &#8220;Supreme Court Blocks Native Hawaiians&#8217; Attempt to Form Own Government,&#8221; http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-hawaii-election_us_565f6849e4b079b2818d1767.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1164436882541">Despite significant advances, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians still trail behind U.S. citizens of other ethnic backgrounds in many important areas. These groups continue to suffer widespread poverty and high unemployment. Some of the poorest counties in the United States are those in which Native American reservations are located. These minorities are also less likely than white Americans, African Americans, or Asian Americans to complete high school or college.<a href="#rf-113" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-113">Jens Manuel Krogstad. 13 June 2014. &#8220;One-in-Four Native Americans and Alaska Natives Are Living in Poverty,&#8221; http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/13/1-in-4-native-americans-and-alaska-natives-are-living-in-poverty/.</div></a> Many American Indian and Alaskan tribes endure high rates of infant mortality, alcoholism, and suicide.<a href="#rf-114" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-114">Karina L.

<p id="fs-id1164436868038">At the beginning of U.S. history, Indians were considered citizens of sovereign nations and thus ineligible for citizenship, and they were forced off their ancestral lands and onto reservations. Interest in Indian rights arose in the late nineteenth century, and in the 1930s, Native Americans were granted a degree of control over reservation lands and the right to govern themselves. Following World War II, they won greater rights to govern themselves, educate their children, decide how tribal lands should be used&#8212;to build casinos, for example&#8212;and practice traditional religious rituals without federal interference. Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians have faced similar difficulties, but since the 1960s, they have been somewhat successful in having lands restored to them or obtaining compensation for their loss. Despite these achievements, members of these groups still tend to be poorer, less educated, less likely to be employed, and more likely to suffer addictions or to be incarcerated than other racial and ethnic groups in the United States.</p>
