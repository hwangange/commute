<p id="fs-id1166226303295">Waging a successful war against Great Britain required that the individual colonies, now sovereign states that often distrusted one another, form a unified nation with a central government capable of directing the country&#8217;s defense. Gaining recognition and aid from foreign nations would also be easier if the new United States had a national government able to borrow money and negotiate treaties. Accordingly, the Second Continental Congress called upon its delegates to create a new government strong enough to win the country&#8217;s independence but not so powerful that it would deprive people of the very liberties for which they were fighting.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1166226387823"><h3 data-type="title">PUTTING A NEW GOVERNMENT IN PLACE</h3>
<p id="fs-id1166226288672">The final draft of the <span data-type="term">Articles of Confederation</span>, which formed the basis of the new nation&#8217;s government, was accepted by Congress in November 1777 and submitted to the states for ratification. It would not become the law of the land until all thirteen states had approved it. Within two years, all except Maryland had done so. Maryland argued that all territory west of the Appalachians, to which some states had laid claim, should instead be held by the national government as public land for the benefit of all the states. When the last of these states, Virginia, relinquished its land claims in early 1781, Maryland approved the Articles.<a href="#rf-1243" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-1243">Stuart Bruchey. 1990. Enterprise: <em data-effect="italics">The Dynamic Economy of a Free People</em>. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 223.</div></a> A few months later, the British surrendered.</p><p id="fs-id1166226350407">Americans wished their new government to be a <span data-type="term">republic</span>, a regime in which the people, not a monarch, held power and elected representatives to govern according to the rule of law. Many, however, feared that a nation as large as the United States could not be ruled effectively as a republic. Many also worried that even a government of representatives elected by the people might become too powerful and overbearing. Thus, a <span data-type="term">confederation</span> was created&#8212;an entity in which independent, self-governing states form a union for the purpose of acting together in areas such as defense. Fearful of replacing one oppressive national government with another, however, the framers of the Articles of Confederation created an alliance of sovereign states held together by a weak central government.</p>

</div>
<p id="fs-id1166226381881">Following the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Declaration of Independence</span>, each of the thirteen states had drafted and ratified a constitution providing for a republican form of government in which political power rested in the hands of the people, although the right to vote was limited to free (white) men, and the property requirements for voting differed among the states. Each state had a governor and an elected legislature. In the new nation, the states remained free to govern their residents as they wished. The central government had authority to act in only a few areas, such as national defense, in which the states were assumed to have a common interest (and would, indeed, have to supply militias). This arrangement was meant to prevent the national government from becoming too powerful or abusing the rights of individual citizens. In the careful balance between power for the national government and liberty for the states, the Articles of Confederation favored the states.</p>
<p id="fs-id1166226357516">Thus, powers given to the central government were severely limited. The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Confederation Congress</span>, formerly the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Continental Congress</span>, had the authority to exchange ambassadors and make treaties with foreign governments and Indian tribes, declare war, coin currency and borrow money, and settle disputes between states. Each state legislature appointed delegates to the Congress; these men could be recalled at any time. Regardless of its size or the number of delegates it chose to send, each state would have only one vote. Delegates could serve for no more than three consecutive years, lest a class of elite professional politicians develop. The nation would have no independent chief executive or judiciary. Nine votes were required before the central government could act, and the Articles of Confederation could be changed only by unanimous approval of all thirteen states.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1166226361366"><h3 data-type="title">WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THE ARTICLES?</h3>
<p id="fs-id1166226361852">The Articles of Confederation satisfied the desire of those in the new nation who wanted a weak central government with limited power. Ironically, however, their very success led to their undoing. It soon became apparent that, while they protected the sovereignty of the states, the Articles had created a central government too weak to function effectively.</p>
<p id="fs-id1166226331298">One of the biggest problems was that the national government had no power to impose <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">taxes</span>. To avoid any perception of &#8220;taxation without representation,&#8221; the Articles of Confederation allowed only state governments to levy taxes. To pay for its expenses, the national government had to request money from the states, which were required to provide funds in proportion to the value of the land within their borders. The states, however, were often negligent in this duty, and the national government was underfunded. Without money, it could not pay debts owed from the Revolution and had trouble conducting foreign affairs. For example, the inability of the U.S. government to raise sufficient funds to compensate colonists who had remained loyal to Great Britain for their property losses during and after the American Revolution was one of the reasons the British refused to evacuate the land west of the Appalachians. The new nation was also unable to protect American ships from attacks by the Barbary pirates.<a href="#rf-12344" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-12344">Joseph J. Ellis. 2015. <em data-effect="italics">The Quartet: Orchestrating the Second American Revolution, 1783-1789</em>. New York: Knopf, 92.</div></a> Foreign governments were also, understandably, reluctant to loan money to a nation that might never repay it because it lacked the ability to tax its citizens.</p>
<p id="fs-id1166226309225">The fiscal problems of the central government meant that the currency it issued, called the Continental, was largely worthless and people were reluctant to use it. Furthermore, while the Articles of Confederation had given the national government the power to coin money, they had not prohibited the states from doing so as well. As a result, numerous state banks issued their own banknotes, which had the same problems as the Continental. People who were unfamiliar with the reputation of the banks that had issued the banknotes often refused to accept them as currency. This reluctance, together with the overwhelming debts of the states, crippled the young nation&#8217;s economy.</p>
<p id="fs-id1166226342462">The country&#8217;s economic woes were made worse by the fact that the central government also lacked the power to impose tariffs on foreign imports or regulate interstate commerce. Thus, it was unable to prevent British merchants from flooding the U.S. market with low-priced goods after the Revolution, and American producers suffered from the competition. Compounding the problem, states often imposed tariffs on items produced by other states and otherwise interfered with their neighbors&#8217; trade.</p>
<p id="fs-id1166226445916">The national government also lacked the power to raise an army or navy. Fears of a standing army in the employ of a tyrannical government had led the writers of the Articles of Confederation to leave defense largely to the states. Although the central government could declare war and agree to peace, it had to depend upon the states to provide soldiers. If state governors chose not to honor the national government&#8217;s request, the country would lack an adequate defense. This was quite dangerous at a time when England and Spain still controlled large portions of North America (<a href="#fs-id1166226365354" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

</tbody></table><p id="fs-id1166226335510">The weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation, already recognized by many, became apparent to all as a result of an uprising of Massachusetts farmers, led by Daniel <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Shays</span>. Known as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Shays&#8217; Rebellion</span>, the incident panicked the governor of Massachusetts, who called upon the national government for assistance. However, with no power to raise an army, the government had no troops at its disposal. After several months, Massachusetts crushed the uprising with the help of local militias and privately funded armies, but wealthy people were frightened by this display of unrest on the part of poor men and by similar incidents taking place in other states.<a href="#rf-12345" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-12345">David P.

<p id="fs-id1166226338869">In the summer of 1786, farmers in western Massachusetts were heavily in debt, facing imprisonment and the loss of their lands. They owed taxes that had gone unpaid while they were away fighting the British during the Revolution. The Continental Congress had promised to pay them for their service, but the national government did not have sufficient money. Moreover, the farmers were unable to meet the onerous new tax burden Massachusetts imposed in order to pay its own debts from the Revolution.</p>
<p id="fs-id1166226318505">Led by Daniel Shays (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_02_02_ShaysRebel" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), the heavily indebted farmers marched to a local courthouse demanding relief. Faced with the refusal of many Massachusetts militiamen to arrest the rebels, with whom they sympathized, Governor James Bowdoin called upon the national government for aid, but none was available. The uprising was finally brought to an end the following year by a privately funded militia after the protestors&#8217; unsuccessful attempt to raid the Springfield Armory.</p>

<p id="fs-id1166226338993">Fearful of creating a system so powerful that it might abuse its citizens, the men who drafted the Articles of Confederation deliberately sought to limit the powers of the national government. The states maintained the right to govern their residents, while the national government could declare war, coin money, and conduct foreign affairs but little else. Its inability to impose taxes, regulate commerce, or raise an army hindered its ability to defend the nation or pay its debts. A solution had to be found.</p>
