<p id="fs-id1163757466568">The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Supreme Court</span> of the United States, sometimes abbreviated SCOTUS, is a one-of-a-kind institution. While a look at the Supreme Court typically focuses on the nine justices themselves, they represent only the top layer of an entire branch of government that includes many administrators, lawyers, and assistants who contribute to and help run the overall judicial system. The Court has its own set of rules for choosing cases, and it follows a unique set of procedures for hearing them. Its decisions not only affect the outcome of the individual case before the justices, but they also create lasting impacts on legal and constitutional interpretation for the future.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1163757367550"><h3 data-type="title">THE STRUCTURE OF THE SUPREME COURT</h3>
<p id="fs-id1163755115673">The original court in 1789 had six justices, but Congress set the number at nine in 1869, and it has remained there ever since. There is one <span data-type="term">chief justice</span>, who is the lead or highest-ranking judge on the Court, and eight <span data-type="term">associate justice</span><strong data-effect="bold">s</strong>. All nine serve lifetime terms, after successful nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163757195571">The current court is fairly diverse in terms of gender, religion (Christians and Jews), ethnicity, and ideology, as well as length of tenure. Some justices have served for three decades, whereas others were only recently appointed by President Obama. <a href="#OSC_AmGov_13_04_Appoint" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> lists the names of the eight justices serving on the Court as of November 2016, along with their year of appointment and the president who nominated them.</p><figure id="OSC_AmGov_13_04_Appoint">

<p id="fs-id1163757362363">With the death of Associate Justice Antonin <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Scalia</span> in February 2016, there remain three current justices who are considered part of the Court&#8217;s more conservative wing&#8212;Chief Justice <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Roberts</span> and Associate Justices <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Thomas</span> and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Alito</span>, while four are considered more liberal-leaning&#8212;Justices <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Ginsburg</span>, Breyer, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Sotomayor</span>, and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Kagan</span> (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_13_04_Justices" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Justice <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Kennedy</span> has become known as the &#8220;swing&#8221; vote, particularly on decisions like the Court&#8217;s same-sex marriage rulings in 2015, because he sometimes takes a more liberal position and sometimes a more conservative one. Had the Democrats retained the presidency in 2016, the replacement for Scalia&#8217;s spot on the court could have swung many key votes in a moderate or liberal direction. However, with Republican Donald Trump winning the election and the Republicans retaining Senate control, it is likely that the replacement in 2017 will be more conservative.

<p id="fs-id1163757215516">In fact, none of the justices works completely in an ideological bubble. While their numerous opinions have revealed certain ideological tendencies, they still consider each case as it comes to them, and they don&#8217;t always rule in a consistently predictable or expected way. Furthermore, they don&#8217;t work exclusively on their own. Each justice has three or four law clerks, recent law school graduates who temporarily work for him or her, do research, help prepare the justice with background information, and assist with the writing of opinions. The law clerks&#8217; work and recommendations influence whether the justices will choose to hear a case, as well as how they will rule. As the profile below reveals, the role of the clerks is as significant as it is varied.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1163757356993"><h3 data-type="title">HOW THE SUPREME COURT SELECTS CASES</h3>
<p id="fs-id1163757297562">The <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Supreme Court</span> begins its annual session on the first Monday in October and ends late the following June. Every year, there are literally thousands of people who would like to have their case heard before the Supreme Court, but the justices will select only a handful to be placed on the <span data-type="term">docket</span>, which is the list of cases scheduled on the Court&#8217;s calendar. The Court typically accepts fewer than 2 percent of the as many as ten thousand cases it is asked to review every year.<a href="#rf-47" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-47">&#8220;Supreme Court Procedures.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">United States Courts</em>. http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/supreme-1 (March 1, 2016).</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1163757294021">Case names, written in italics, list the name of a petitioner versus a respondent, as in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis"><em data-effect="italics">Roe v. Wade</em></span>, for example.<a href="#rf-48" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-48"><em data-effect="italics">Roe v. Wade</em>, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).</div></a> For a case on appeal, you can tell which party lost at the lower level of court by looking at the case name: The party unhappy with the decision of the lower court is the one bringing the appeal and is thus the petitioner, or the first-named party in the case. For example, in <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis"><em data-effect="italics">Brown v. Board of Education</em></span> (1954), Oliver Brown was one of the thirteen parents who brought suit against the Topeka public schools for discrimination based on racial segregation.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163757278556">Most often, the petitioner is asking the Supreme Court to grant a <span data-type="term">writ of <em data-effect="italics">certiorari</em></span>, a request that the lower court send up its record of the case for review. Once a writ of <em data-effect="italics">certiorari</em> (<em data-effect="italics">cert</em>. for short) has been granted, the case is scheduled on the Court&#8217;s docket. The Supreme Court exercises discretion in the cases it chooses to hear, but four of the nine Justices must vote to accept a case. This is called the <span data-type="term">Rule of Four</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163757580664">For decisions about <em data-effect="italics">cert</em>., the Court&#8217;s Rule 10 (Considerations Governing Review on Writ of <em data-effect="italics">Certiorari</em>) takes precedence.<a href="#rf-49" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-49">&#8221;Rule 10. Considerations Governing Review on <em data-effect="italics">Certiorari</em>.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States</em>. Adopted April 19, 2013, Effective July 1, 2013. http://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/2013RulesoftheCourt.pdf.</div></a> The Court is more likely to grant <em data-effect="italics">certiorari</em> when there is a conflict on an issue between or among the lower courts. Examples of conflicts include (1) conflicting decisions among different courts of appeals on the same matter, (2) decisions by an appeals court or a state court conflicting with precedent, and (3) state court decisions that conflict with federal decisions. Occasionally, the Court will fast-track a case that has special urgency, such as <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis"><em data-effect="italics">Bush v. Gore</em></span> in the wake of the 2000 election.<a href="#rf-50" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-50"><em data-effect="italics">Bush v. Gore</em>, 531 U.S. 98 (2000).</div></a></p><p id="fs-id1163757280981">Past research indicated that the amount of interest-group activity surrounding a case before it is granted <em data-effect="italics">cert.</em> has a significant impact on whether the Supreme Court puts the case on its agenda. The more activity, the more likely the case will be placed on the docket.<a href="#rf-51" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-51">Gregory A. Caldeira and John R. Wright. 1988. &#8220;Organized Interests and Agenda-Setting in the U.S. Supreme Court,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">American Political Science Review</em> 82: 1109&#8211;1128.</div></a> But more recent research broadens that perspective, suggesting that too much interest-group activity when the Court is considering a case for its docket may actually have diminishing impact and that external actors may have less influence on the work of the Court than they have had in the past.<a href="#rf-52" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-52">Gregory A. Caldeira, John R.

<p id="fs-id1163757465723">The <span data-type="term">solicitor general</span> is the lawyer who represents the federal government before the Supreme Court: He or she decides which cases (in which the United States is a party) should be appealed from the lower courts and personally approves each one presented (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_13_04_Verrilli" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Most of the cases the solicitor general brings to the Court will be given a place on the docket. About two-thirds of all Supreme Court cases involve the federal government.<a href="#rf-53" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-53">&#8220;About the Office.&#8221; Office of the Solicitor General. <em data-effect="italics">The United States Department of Justice</em>. http://www.justice.gov/osg/about-office-1 (March 1, 2016).</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1163757281603">The solicitor general determines the position the government will take on a case. The attorneys of his or her office prepare and file the petitions and briefs, and the solicitor general (or an assistant) presents the oral arguments before the Court.</p>
<figure id="OSC_AmGov_13_04_Verrilli"><figcaption>Thurgood <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Marshall</span> (a), who later served on the Supreme Court, was appointed solicitor general by Lyndon Johnson and was the first African American to hold the post.

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-id1163757210022">In other cases in which the United States is not the petitioner or the respondent, the solicitor general may choose to intervene or comment as a third party. Before a case is granted <em data-effect="italics">cert.</em>, the justices will sometimes ask the solicitor general to comment on or file a brief in the case, indicating their potential interest in getting it on the docket. The solicitor general may also recommend that the justices decline to hear a case. Though research has shown that the solicitor general&#8217;s special influence on the Court is not unlimited, it remains quite significant. In particular, the Court does not always agree with the solicitor general, and &#8220;while justices are not lemmings who will unwittingly fall off legal cliffs for tortured solicitor general recommendations, they nevertheless often go along with them even when we least expect them to.&#8221;<a href="#rf-54" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-54">Ryan C.

<p id="fs-id1163757218900">Some have credited Donald B. Verrilli, the solicitor general under President Obama, with holding special sway over the five-justice majority ruling on same-sex marriage in June 2015.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1163757368744"><h3 data-type="title">SUPREME COURT PROCEDURES</h3>
<p id="fs-id1163757580986">Once a case has been placed on the docket, <span data-type="term">briefs</span>, or short arguments explaining each party&#8217;s view of the case, must be submitted&#8212;first by the petitioner putting forth his or her case, then by the respondent. After initial briefs have been filed, both parties may file subsequent briefs in response to the first. Likewise, people and groups that are not party to the case but are interested in its outcome may file an <span data-type="term"><em data-effect="italics">amicus curiae</em></span> (&#8220;friend of the court&#8221;) brief giving their opinion, analysis, and recommendations about how the Court should rule. Interest groups in particular can become heavily involved in trying to influence the judiciary by filing <em data-effect="italics">amicus</em> briefs&#8212;both before and after a case has been granted <em data-effect="italics">cert</em>. And, as noted earlier, if the United States is not party to a case, the solicitor general may file an <em data-effect="italics">amicus</em> brief on the government&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163755284466">With briefs filed, the Court hears <span data-type="term">oral argument</span><strong data-effect="bold">s</strong> in cases from October through April. The proceedings are quite ceremonial. When the Court is in session, the robed justices make a formal entrance into the courtroom to a standing audience and the sound of a banging gavel. The Court&#8217;s marshal presents them with a traditional chant: &#8220;The Honorable, the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! [Hear ye!] All persons having business before the Honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States, are admonished to draw near and give their attention, for the Court is now sitting.

May 26, 2015.</div></a> It has not gone unnoticed that the Court, which has defended the First Amendment&#8217;s religious protection and the traditional separation of church and state, opens its every public session with a mention of God.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163757302326">During oral arguments, each side&#8217;s lawyers have thirty minutes to make their legal case, though the justices often interrupt the presentations with questions. The justices consider oral arguments not as a forum for a lawyer to restate the merits of his or her case as written in the briefs, but as an opportunity to get answers to any questions they may have.<a href="#rf-57" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-57">&#8220;Supreme Court Procedures.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">United States Courts</em>. http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/supreme-1 (March 1, 2016).</div></a> When the United States is party to a case, the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">solicitor general</span> (or one of his or her assistants) will argue the government&#8217;s position; even in other cases, the solicitor general may still be given time to express the government&#8217;s position on the dispute.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163757313411">When oral arguments have been concluded, the justices have to decide the case, and they do so in <span data-type="term">conference</span>, which is held in private twice a week when the Court is in session and once a week when it is not. The conference is also a time to discuss petitions for <em data-effect="italics">certiorari</em>, but for those cases already heard, each justice may state his or her views on the case, ask questions, or raise concerns. The chief justice speaks first about a case, then each justice speaks in turn, in descending order of seniority, ending with the most recently appointed justice.<a href="#rf-58" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-58">&#8220;Supreme Court Procedures.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">United States Courts</em>. http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/supreme-1 (March 1, 2016).</div></a> The judges take an initial vote in private before the official announcement of their decisions is made public.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163757318615">Oral arguments are open to the public, but cameras are not allowed in the courtroom, so the only picture we get is one drawn by an artist&#8217;s hand, an illustration or rendering. Cameras seem to be everywhere today, especially to provide security in places such as schools, public buildings, and retail stores, so the lack of live coverage of Supreme Court proceedings may seem unusual or old-fashioned. Over the years, groups have called for the Court to let go of this tradition and open its operations to more &#8220;sunshine&#8221; and greater transparency. Nevertheless, the justices have resisted the pressure and remain neither filmed nor photographed during oral arguments.<a href="#rf-59" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-59">Jonathan Sherman. &#8220;End the Supreme Court's Ban on Cameras.&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">New York Times</em>. 24 April 2015. http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/opinion/open-the-supreme-court-to-cameras.html.</div></a></p>

<p id="fs-id1163755399290">A unique institution, the U.S. Supreme Court today is an interesting mix of the traditional and the modern. On one hand, it still holds to many of the formal traditions, processes, and procedures it has followed for many decades. Its public proceedings remain largely ceremonial and are never filmed or photographed. At the same time, the Court has taken on new cases involving contemporary matters before a nine-justice panel that is more diverse today than ever before. When considering whether to take on a case and then later when ruling on it, the justices rely on a number of internal and external players who assist them with and influence their work, including, but not limited to, their law clerks, the U.S. solicitor general, interest groups, and the mass media.</p>
