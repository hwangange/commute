<para id="fs-id1163758456347">The federal design of our Constitution has had a profound effect on U.S. politics. Several positive and negative attributes of federalism have manifested themselves in the U.S. political system.</para>
<section id="fs-id1163758543014">
<title>THE BENEFITS OF FEDERALISM</title>
<para id="fs-id1163758408914">Among the merits of federalism are that it promotes policy innovation and political participation and accommodates diversity of opinion. On the subject of policy innovation, Supreme Court Justice Louis <term class="no-emphasis">Brandeis</term> observed in 1932 that “a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.”<cite target-id="rf-069"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-069"><emphasis effect="italics">New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann</emphasis>, 285 U.S. 262 (1932).</note></cite> What Brandeis meant was that states could harness their constitutional authority to engage in policy innovations that might eventually be diffused to other states and at the national level. For example, a number of New Deal breakthroughs, such as child labor laws, were inspired by state policies. Prior to the passage of the <term class="no-emphasis">Nineteenth Amendment</term>, several states had already granted women the right to vote. California has led the way in establishing standards for fuel emissions and other environmental policies (<link target-id="OSC_AmGov_03_05_California"/>). Recently, the health insurance exchanges run by Connecticut, Kentucky, Rhode Island, and Washington have served as models for other states seeking to improve the performance of their exchanges.<cite target-id="rf-070"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-070">Christine Vestal and Michael Ollove, “Why some state-run health exchanges worked,” <emphasis effect="italics">USA Today</emphasis>, 10 December 2013.</note></cite></para>

<caption>The California Air Resources Board was established in 1967, before passage of the federal Clean Air Act.

Nissinen; credit b: modification of work by Marcin Wichary)</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1163758488722">Another advantage of federalism is that because our federal system creates two levels of government with the capacity to take action, failure to attain a desired policy goal at one level can be offset by successfully securing the support of elected representatives at another level. Thus, individuals, groups, and social movements are encouraged to actively participate and help shape public policy.</para>

<title>Federalism and Political Office</title>
<para id="fs-id1163758497090">Thinking of running for elected office? Well, you have several options. As <link target-id="fs-id1163758526952"/> shows, there are a total of 510,682 elected offices at the federal, state, and local levels. Elected representatives in municipal and township governments account for a little more than half the total number of elected officials in the United States. Political careers rarely start at the national level. In fact, a very small share of politicians at the subnational level transition to the national stage as representatives, senators, vice presidents, or presidents.</para>
<table id="fs-id1163758526952" summary="Table shows the number of elective bodies and number of elective officials at the Federal, State, and Local levels. The Federal Government has 1 elective body. The Executive branch has 2 elected officials. The U.S. Senate has 100 elected officials. The U.S. House of Representatives has 435 elected officials. The state government has 50 elective bodies. The state legislatures have 7,382 elected officials. The statewide offices have 1,036 elected officials. State boards have 1,331 elected officials. Local governments have 3,034 elective bodies with 58,818 elected officials. Municipal governments have 19,429 elective bodies and 135,531 elected officials. Town governments have 16,504 elective bodies and 126,958 elected officials. School districts have 13,506 elective bodies and 95,000 elected officials.

<para id="fs-id1163758492937">The system of checks and balances in our political system often prevents the federal government from imposing uniform policies across the country. As a result, states and local communities have the latitude to address policy issues based on the specific needs and interests of their citizens. The diversity of public viewpoints across states is manifested by differences in the way states handle access to abortion, distribution of alcohol, gun control, and social welfare benefits, for example.</para>

<title>THE DRAWBACKS OF FEDERALISM</title>
<para id="fs-id1163758474660">Federalism also comes with drawbacks. Chief among them are economic disparities across states, <term>race-to-the-bottom</term> dynamics (i.e., states compete to attract business by lowering taxes and regulations), and the difficulty of taking action on issues of national importance.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163758414676">Stark economic differences across states have a profound effect on the well-being of citizens. For example, in 2014, Maryland had the highest median household income ($73,971), while Mississippi had the lowest ($39,680).<cite target-id="rf-073"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-073">See http://www.deptofnumbers.com/income/ for more data on household income.</note></cite> There are also huge disparities in school funding across states. In 2013, New York spent $19,818 per student for elementary and secondary education, while Utah spent $6,555.<cite target-id="rf-074"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-074">Governing. “Education Spending Per Student by State.” http://www.governing.com/gov-data/education-data/state-education-spending-per-pupil-data.html (June 24, 2015).</note></cite> Furthermore, health-care access, costs, and quality vary greatly across states.<cite target-id="rf-075"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-075">The Commonwealth Fund. “Aiming Higher: Results from a Scorecard on State Health System Performance, 2014.” http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2014/apr/2014-state-scorecard (June 24, 2015).</note></cite> Proponents of social justice contend that federalism has tended to obstruct national efforts to effectively even out these disparities.</para>

</note>
<para id="fs-id1163758469132">The economic strategy of using race-to-the-bottom tactics in order to compete with other states in attracting new business growth also carries a social cost. For example, workers’ safety and pay can suffer as workplace regulations are lifted, and the reduction in payroll taxes for employers has led a number of states to end up with underfunded unemployment insurance programs.<cite target-id="rf-076"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-076">Alexander Hertel-Fernandez. 2012. “Why U.S. Unemployment Insurance is in Financial Trouble,” February. http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/sites/default/files/ssn_basic_facts_hertel-fernandez_on_unemployment_insurance_financing.pdf</note></cite> Nineteen states have also opted not to cover more of their residents under Medicaid, as encouraged by the Patient Protection and <term class="no-emphasis">Affordable Care Act</term> in 2010, for fear it will raise state public spending and increase employers’ cost of employee benefits, despite provisions that the federal government will pick up nearly all cost of the expansion.<cite target-id="rf-077"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-077">Matt Broaddus and January Angeles. 2012. “Federal Government Will Pick Up Nearly All Costs of Health Reform’s Medicaid Expansion,” March 28. http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-government-will-pick-up-nearly-all-costs-of-health-reforms-medicaid-expansion</note></cite> More than half of these states are in the South.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163758326014">The federal design of our Constitution and the system of checks and balances has jeopardized or outright blocked federal responses to important national issues. President Roosevelt’s efforts to combat the scourge of the Great Depression were initially struck down by the Supreme Court. More recently, President Obama’s effort to make health insurance accessible to more Americans under the Affordable Care Act immediately ran into legal challenges<cite target-id="rf-078"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-078"><emphasis effect="italics">National Federation of Independent Business v.
