<p id="fs-id1163758456347">The federal design of our Constitution has had a profound effect on U.S. politics. Several positive and negative attributes of federalism have manifested themselves in the U.S. political system.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1163758543014"><h3 data-type="title">THE BENEFITS OF FEDERALISM</h3>
<p id="fs-id1163758408914">Among the merits of federalism are that it promotes policy innovation and political participation and accommodates diversity of opinion. On the subject of policy innovation, Supreme Court Justice Louis <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Brandeis</span> observed in 1932 that &#8220;a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.&#8221;<a href="#rf-069" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-069"><em data-effect="italics">New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann</em>, 285 U.S. 262 (1932).</div></a> What Brandeis meant was that states could harness their constitutional authority to engage in policy innovations that might eventually be diffused to other states and at the national level. For example, a number of New Deal breakthroughs, such as child labor laws, were inspired by state policies. Prior to the passage of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nineteenth Amendment</span>, several states had already granted women the right to vote. California has led the way in establishing standards for fuel emissions and other environmental policies (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_03_05_California" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Recently, the health insurance exchanges run by Connecticut, Kentucky, Rhode Island, and Washington have served as models for other states seeking to improve the performance of their exchanges.<a href="#rf-070" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-070">Christine Vestal and Michael Ollove, &#8220;Why some state-run health exchanges worked,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">USA Today</em>, 10 December 2013.</div></a></p>
<figure id="OSC_AmGov_03_05_California"><figcaption>The California Air Resources Board was established in 1967, before passage of the federal Clean Air Act.

<p id="fs-id1163758488722">Another advantage of federalism is that because our federal system creates two levels of government with the capacity to take action, failure to attain a desired policy goal at one level can be offset by successfully securing the support of elected representatives at another level. Thus, individuals, groups, and social movements are encouraged to actively participate and help shape public policy.</p>
<div data-type="note" id="fs-id1163758527294" class="get-connected"><div data-type="title">Federalism and Political Office</div>
<p id="fs-id1163758497090">Thinking of running for elected office? Well, you have several options. As <a href="#fs-id1163758526952" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows, there are a total of 510,682 elected offices at the federal, state, and local levels. Elected representatives in municipal and township governments account for a little more than half the total number of elected officials in the United States. Political careers rarely start at the national level. In fact, a very small share of politicians at the subnational level transition to the national stage as representatives, senators, vice presidents, or presidents.</p>

<p id="fs-id1163758426944">If you are interested in serving the public as an elected official, there are more opportunities to do so at the local and state levels than at the national level. As an added incentive for setting your sights at the subnational stage, consider the following. Whereas only 28 percent of U.S. adults trusted Congress in 2014, about 62 percent trusted their state governments and 72 percent had confidence in their local governments.<a href="#rf-072" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-072">Justin McCarthy. 2014. &#8220;Americans Still Trust Local Government More Than State,&#8221; September 22. http://www.gallup.com/poll/176846/americans-trust-local-government-state.aspx (June 24, 2015).</div></a></p>

</div>
<p id="fs-id1163758492937">The system of checks and balances in our political system often prevents the federal government from imposing uniform policies across the country. As a result, states and local communities have the latitude to address policy issues based on the specific needs and interests of their citizens. The diversity of public viewpoints across states is manifested by differences in the way states handle access to abortion, distribution of alcohol, gun control, and social welfare benefits, for example.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1163758307960"><h3 data-type="title">THE DRAWBACKS OF FEDERALISM</h3>
<p id="fs-id1163758474660">Federalism also comes with drawbacks. Chief among them are economic disparities across states, <span data-type="term">race-to-the-bottom</span> dynamics (i.e., states compete to attract business by lowering taxes and regulations), and the difficulty of taking action on issues of national importance.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758414676">Stark economic differences across states have a profound effect on the well-being of citizens. For example, in 2014, Maryland had the highest median household income ($73,971), while Mississippi had the lowest ($39,680).<a href="#rf-073" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-073">See http://www.deptofnumbers.com/income/ for more data on household income.</div></a> There are also huge disparities in school funding across states. In 2013, New York spent $19,818 per student for elementary and secondary education, while Utah spent $6,555.<a href="#rf-074" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-074">Governing. &#8220;Education Spending Per Student by State.&#8221; http://www.governing.com/gov-data/education-data/state-education-spending-per-pupil-data.html (June 24, 2015).</div></a> Furthermore, health-care access, costs, and quality vary greatly across states.<a href="#rf-075" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-075">The Commonwealth Fund. &#8220;Aiming Higher: Results from a Scorecard on State Health System Performance, 2014.&#8221; http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2014/apr/2014-state-scorecard (June 24, 2015).</div></a> Proponents of social justice contend that federalism has tended to obstruct national efforts to effectively even out these disparities.</p>

</div>
<p id="fs-id1163758469132">The economic strategy of using race-to-the-bottom tactics in order to compete with other states in attracting new business growth also carries a social cost. For example, workers&#8217; safety and pay can suffer as workplace regulations are lifted, and the reduction in payroll taxes for employers has led a number of states to end up with underfunded unemployment insurance programs.<a href="#rf-076" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-076">Alexander Hertel-Fernandez. 2012. &#8220;Why U.S. Unemployment Insurance is in Financial Trouble,&#8221; February. http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/sites/default/files/ssn_basic_facts_hertel-fernandez_on_unemployment_insurance_financing.pdf</div></a> Nineteen states have also opted not to cover more of their residents under Medicaid, as encouraged by the Patient Protection and <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Affordable Care Act</span> in 2010, for fear it will raise state public spending and increase employers&#8217; cost of employee benefits, despite provisions that the federal government will pick up nearly all cost of the expansion.<a href="#rf-077" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-077">Matt Broaddus and January Angeles. 2012. &#8220;Federal Government Will Pick Up Nearly All Costs of Health Reform&#8217;s Medicaid Expansion,&#8221; March 28. http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-government-will-pick-up-nearly-all-costs-of-health-reforms-medicaid-expansion</div></a> More than half of these states are in the South.</p>
<p id="fs-id1163758326014">The federal design of our Constitution and the system of checks and balances has jeopardized or outright blocked federal responses to important national issues. President Roosevelt&#8217;s efforts to combat the scourge of the Great Depression were initially struck down by the Supreme Court. More recently, President Obama&#8217;s effort to make health insurance accessible to more Americans under the Affordable Care Act immediately ran into legal challenges<a href="#rf-078" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-078"><em data-effect="italics">National Federation of Independent Business v.

However, the federal government&#8217;s ability to defend the voting rights of citizens suffered a major setback when the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a key provision of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Voting Rights Act of 1965</span>.<a href="#rf-079" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-079"><em data-effect="italics">Shelby County v.
