<p id="fs-id1164435629403">Along with African Americans, women of all races and ethnicities have long been discriminated against in the United States, and the women&#8217;s rights movement began at the same time as the movement to abolish slavery in the United States. Indeed, the women&#8217;s movement came about largely as a result of the difficulties women encountered while trying to abolish slavery. The trailblazing Seneca Falls Convention for women&#8217;s rights was held in 1848, a few years before the Civil War. But the abolition and African American civil rights movements largely eclipsed the women&#8217;s movement throughout most of the nineteenth century. Women began to campaign actively again in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and another movement for women&#8217;s rights began in the 1960s.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1164435862914"><h3 data-type="title">THE EARLY WOMEN&#8217;S RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND WOMEN&#8217;S SUFFRAGE</h3>
<p id="fs-id1164435932969">At the time of the American Revolution, women had few rights. Although single women were allowed to own property, married women were not. When women married, their separate legal identities were erased under the legal principle of <span data-type="term">coverture</span>. Not only did women adopt their husbands&#8217; names, but all personal property they owned legally became their husbands&#8217; property. Husbands could not sell their wives&#8217; real property&#8212;such as land or in some states slaves&#8212;without their permission, but they were allowed to manage it and retain the profits. If women worked outside the home, their husbands were entitled to their wages.<a href="#rf-060" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-060">Mary Beth Norton. 1980. <em data-effect="italics">Liberty&#8217;s Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women, 1750&#8211;1800</em>. New York: Little, Brown, and Company, 46.</div></a> So long as a man provided food, clothing, and shelter for his wife, she was not legally allowed to leave him. Divorce was difficult and in some places impossible to obtain.<a href="#rf-061" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-061">Ibid., 47.</div></a> Higher education for women was not available, and women were barred from professional positions in medicine, law, and ministry.</p>
<p id="fs-id1164435558941">Following the Revolution, women&#8217;s conditions did not improve. Women were not granted the right to vote by any of the states except New Jersey, which at first allowed all taxpaying property owners to vote. However, in 1807, the law changed to limit the vote to men.<a href="#rf-062" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-062">Jan Ellen Lewis. 2011. &#8220;Rethinking Women&#8217;s Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776&#8211;1807,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Rutgers Law Review</em> 63, No. 3, http://www.rutgerslawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/vol63/Issue3/Lewis.pdf.</div></a> Changes in property laws actually hurt women by making it easier for their husbands to sell their real property without their consent.</p>
<p id="fs-id1164435731841">Although women had few rights, they nevertheless played an important role in transforming American society. This was especially true in the 1830s and 1840s, a time when numerous social reform movements swept across the United States. Many women were active in these causes, especially the abolition movement and the temperance movement, which tried to end the excessive consumption of liquor. They often found they were hindered in their efforts, however, either by the law or by widely held beliefs that they were weak, silly creatures who should leave important issues to men.<a href="#rf-063" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-063">Keyssar, 174.</div></a> One of the leaders of the early women&#8217;s movement, Elizabeth Cady <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Stanton</span> (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_05_02_StantonMot" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), was shocked and angered when she sought to attend an 1840 antislavery meeting in London, only to learn that women would not be allowed to participate and had to sit apart from the men. At this convention, she made the acquaintance of another American female abolitionist, Lucretia <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Mott</span> (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_05_02_StantonMot" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), who was also appalled by the male reformers&#8217; treatment of women.<a href="#rf-064" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-064">Elizabeth Cady Stanton. 1993. <em data-effect="italics">Eighty Years and More: Reminiscences, 1815&#8211;1897</em>.

<p id="fs-id1164435941325">In 1848, Stanton and Mott called for a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">women&#8217;s rights</span> convention, the first ever held specifically to address the subject, at Seneca Falls, New York. At the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Seneca Falls Convention</span>, Stanton wrote the Declaration of Sentiments, which was modeled after the Declaration of Independence and proclaimed women were equal to men and deserved the same rights. Among the rights Stanton wished to see granted to women was suffrage, the right to vote. When called upon to sign the Declaration, many of the delegates feared that if women demanded the right to vote, the movement would be considered too radical and its members would become a laughingstock. The Declaration passed, but the resolution demanding suffrage was the only one that did not pass unanimously.<a href="#rf-065" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-065">Elizabeth Cady Stanton et al. 1887. <em data-effect="italics">History of Woman Suffrage</em>, vol. 1. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 73.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1164435732146">Along with other feminists (advocates of women&#8217;s equality), such as her friend and colleague Susan B. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Anthony</span>, Stanton fought for rights for women besides suffrage, including the right to seek higher education. As a result of their efforts, several states passed laws that allowed married women to retain control of their property and let divorced women keep custody of their children.<a href="#rf-066" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-066">Jean H. Baker. 2005. <em data-effect="italics">Sisters: The Lives of America&#8217;s Suffragists</em>. New York: Hill and Wang, 109.</div></a> Amelia <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Bloomer</span>, another activist, also campaigned for dress reform, believing women could lead better lives and be more useful to society if they were not restricted by voluminous heavy skirts and tight corsets.</p>
<p id="fs-id1164435630109">The women&#8217;s rights movement attracted many women who, like Stanton and Anthony, were active in either the temperance movement, the abolition movement, or both movements. Sarah and Angelina <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Grimke</span>, the daughters of a wealthy slaveholding family in South Carolina, became first abolitionists and then women&#8217;s rights activists.<a href="#rf-067" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-067">Angelina Grimke. October 2, 1837. &#8220;Letter XII Human Rights Not Founded on Sex.&#8221; In <em data-effect="italics">Letters to Catherine E. Beecher: In Reply to an Essay on Slavery and Abolitionism</em>. Boston: Knapp, 114&#8211;121.</div></a> Many of these women realized that their effectiveness as reformers was limited by laws that prohibited married women from signing contracts and by social proscriptions against women addressing male audiences. Without such rights, women found it difficult to rent halls in which to deliver lectures or to hire printers to produce antislavery literature.</p>
<p id="fs-id1164435643057">Following the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, the women&#8217;s rights movement fragmented. Stanton and Anthony denounced the Fifteenth Amendment because it granted voting rights only to black men and not to women of any race.<a href="#rf-068" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-068">Keyssar, 178.</div></a> The fight for women&#8217;s rights did not die, however. In 1869, Stanton and Anthony formed the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">National Woman Suffrage Association</span> (NWSA), which demanded that the Constitution be amended to grant the right to vote to all women. It also called for more lenient divorce laws and an end to sex discrimination in employment. The less radical Lucy <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Stone</span> formed the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">American Woman Suffrage Association</span> (AWSA) in the same year; AWSA hoped to win the suffrage for women by working on a state-by-state basis instead of seeking to amend the Constitution.<a href="#rf-069" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-069">Keyssar, 184.</div></a> Four western states&#8212;Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and Idaho&#8212;did extend the right to vote to women in the late nineteenth century, but no other states did.</p>
<p id="fs-id1164435650081">Women were also granted the right to vote on matters involving liquor licenses, in school board elections, and in municipal elections in several states. However, this was often done because of stereotyped beliefs that associated women with moral reform and concern for children, not as a result of a belief in women&#8217;s equality. Furthermore, voting in municipal elections was restricted to women who owned property.<a href="#rf-070" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-070">Keyssar, 175, 186&#8211;187.</div></a> In 1890, the two suffragist groups united to form the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">National American Woman Suffrage Association</span> (NAWSA). To call attention to their cause, members circulated petitions, lobbied politicians, and held parades in which hundreds of women and girls marched through the streets (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_05_03_Parade" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="OSC_AmGov_05_03_Parade"><figcaption>In October 1917, suffragists marched down Fifth Avenue in New York demanding the right to vote. They carried a petition that had been signed by one million women.</figcaption>

</figure>
<p id="fs-id1164435843324">The more radical <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">National Woman&#8217;s Party</span> (NWP), led by Alice <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Paul</span>, advocated the use of stronger tactics. The NWP held public protests and picketed outside the White House (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_05_03_NWP" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).<a href="#rf-071" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-071">Keyssar, 214.</div></a> Demonstrators were often beaten and arrested, and suffragists were subjected to cruel treatment in jail. When some, like Paul, began hunger strikes to call attention to their cause, their jailers force-fed them, an incredibly painful and invasive experience for the women.<a href="#rf-072" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-072">&#8220;Alice Paul,&#8221; https://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/alice-paul/ (April 10, 2016).</div></a> Finally, in 1920, the triumphant passage of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nineteenth Amendment</span> granted all women the right to vote.</p>
<figure id="OSC_AmGov_05_03_NWP"><figcaption>Members of the National Woman&#8217;s Party picketed outside the White House six days a week from January 10, 1917, when President Woodrow Wilson took office, until June 4, 1919, when the Nineteenth Amendment was passed by Congress.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1164435730671"><h3 data-type="title">CIVIL RIGHTS AND THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT</h3>
<p id="fs-id1164435592463">Just as the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments did not result in equality for African Americans, the Nineteenth Amendment did not end discrimination against women in education, employment, or other areas of life, which continued to be legal. Although women could vote, they very rarely ran for or held public office. Women continued to be underrepresented in the professions, and relatively few sought advanced degrees. Until the mid-twentieth century, the ideal in U.S. society was typically for women to marry, have children, and become housewives. Those who sought work for pay outside the home were routinely denied jobs because of their sex and, when they did find employment, were paid less than men. Women who wished to remain childless or limit the number of children they had in order to work or attend college found it difficult to do so. In some states it was illegal to sell contraceptive devices, and abortions were largely illegal and difficult for women to obtain.</p>
<p id="fs-id1164435685594">A second women&#8217;s rights movement emerged in the 1960s to address these problems. Title VII of the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Civil Rights Act</span> of 1964 prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of sex as well as race, color, national origin, and religion. Nevertheless, women continued to be denied jobs because of their sex and were often sexually harassed at the workplace. In 1966, feminists who were angered by the lack of progress made by women and by the government&#8217;s lackluster enforcement of <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Title VII</span> organized the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">National Organization for Women</span> (NOW). NOW promoted workplace equality, including equal pay for women, and also called for the greater presence of women in public office, the professions, and graduate and professional degree programs.</p>
<p id="fs-id1164435574701">NOW also declared its support for the <span data-type="term">Equal Rights Amendment</span> <strong data-effect="bold">(ERA)</strong>, which mandated equal treatment for all regardless of sex. The ERA, written by Alice <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Paul</span> and Crystal <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Eastman</span>, was first proposed to Congress, unsuccessfully, in 1923. It was introduced in every Congress thereafter but did not pass both the House and the Senate until 1972. The amendment was then sent to the states for ratification with a deadline of March 22, 1979. Although many states ratified the amendment in 1972 and 1973, the ERA still lacked sufficient support as the deadline drew near. Opponents, including both women and men, argued that passage would subject women to military conscription and deny them alimony and custody of their children should they divorce.<a href="#rf-073" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-073">Deborah Rhode. 2009. <em data-effect="italics">Justice and Gender: Sex Discrimination and the Law</em>. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 66&#8211;67.</div></a> In 1978, Congress voted to extend the deadline for ratification to June 30, 1982. Even with the extension, however, the amendment failed to receive the support of the required thirty-eight states; by the time the deadline arrived, it had been ratified by only thirty-five, some of those had rescinded their ratifications, and no new state had ratified the ERA during the extension period (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_05_03_ERA" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="OSC_AmGov_05_03_ERA"><figcaption>The map shows which states supported the ERA and which did not. The dark blue states ratified the amendment. The amendment was ratified but later rescinded in the light blue states and was ratified in only one branch of the legislature in the yellow states.

<p id="fs-id1164435570989">Although the ERA failed to be ratified, <span data-type="term">Title IX</span> of the United States Education Amendments of 1972 passed into law as a federal statute (not as an amendment, as the ERA was meant to be). Title IX applies to all educational institutions that receive federal aid and prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in academic programs, dormitory space, health-care access, and school activities including sports. Thus, if a school receives federal aid, it cannot spend more funds on programs for men than on programs for women.</p>

For example, many states have required abortion clinics to meet the same standards set for hospitals, such as corridor size and parking lot capacity, despite lack of evidence regarding the benefits of such standards. Abortion clinics, which are smaller than hospitals, often cannot meet such standards. Other restrictions include mandated counseling before the procedure and the need for minors to secure parental permission before obtaining abortion services.<a href="#rf-082" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-082">Heather D.

These include laws mandating equal pay for equal work. According to the doctrine of <span data-type="term">comparable worth</span>, people should be compensated equally for work requiring comparable skills, responsibilities, and effort. Thus, even though women are underrepresented in certain fields, they should receive the same wages as men if performing jobs requiring the same level of accountability, knowledge, skills, and/or working conditions, even though the specific job may be different.</p>
<p id="fs-id1164435921942">For example, garbage collectors are largely male. The chief job requirements are the ability to drive a sanitation truck and to lift heavy bins and toss their contents into the back of truck. The average wage for a garbage collector is $15.34 an hour.<a href="#rf-084" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-084">&#8220;Garbage Man Salary (United States),&#8221; http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Garbage_Man/Hourly_Rate (April 10, 2016).</div></a> Daycare workers are largely female, and the average pay is $9.12 an hour.<a href="#rf-085" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-085">&#8220;Child Care/Day Care Worker Salary (United States),&#8221; http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Child_Care_%2F_Day_Care_Worker/Hourly_Rate (April 10, 2016).</div></a> However, the work arguably requires more skills and is a more responsible position. Daycare workers must be able to feed, clean, and dress small children; prepare meals for them; entertain them; give them medicine if required; and teach them basic skills. They must be educated in first aid and assume responsibility for the children&#8217;s safety. In terms of the skills and physical activity required and the associated level of responsibility of the job, daycare workers should be paid at least as much as garbage collectors and perhaps more. Women&#8217;s rights advocates also call for stricter enforcement of laws prohibiting sexual harassment, and for harsher punishment, such as mandatory arrest, for perpetrators of domestic violence.</p>

<p id="fs-id1164435634835">In 1918, the proposed <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Nineteenth Amendment</span> to the Constitution, extending the right to vote to all adult female citizens of the United States, was passed by both houses of Congress and sent to the states for ratification. Thirty-six votes were needed. Throughout 1918 and 1919, the Amendment dragged through legislature after legislature as pro- and anti-suffrage advocates made their arguments. By the summer of 1920, only one more state had to ratify it before it became law. The Amendment passed through Tennessee&#8217;s state Senate and went to its House of Representatives. Arguments were bitter and intense. Pro-suffrage advocates argued that the amendment would reward women for their service to the nation during World War I and that women&#8217;s supposedly greater morality would help to clean up politics. Those opposed claimed women would be degraded by entrance into the political arena and that their interests were already represented by their male relatives. On August 18, the amendment was brought for a vote before the House. The vote was closely divided, and it seemed unlikely it would pass. But as a young anti-suffrage representative waited for his vote to be counted, he remembered a note he had received from his mother that day. In it, she urged him, &#8220;Hurrah and vote for suffrage!&#8221; At the last minute, Harry <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Burn</span> abruptly changed his ballot. The amendment passed the House by one vote, and eight days later, the Nineteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution.</p>

<p id="fs-id1164435639400">At the time of the Revolution and for many decades following it, married women had no right to control their own property, vote, or run for public office. Beginning in the 1840s, a women&#8217;s movement began among women who were active in the abolition and temperance movements. Although some of their goals, such as achieving property rights for married women, were reached early on, their biggest goal&#8212;winning the right to vote&#8212;required the 1920 passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. Women secured more rights in the 1960s and 1970s, such as reproductive rights and the right not to be discriminated against in employment or education. Women continue to face many challenges: they are still paid less than men and are underrepresented in executive positions and elected office.</p>
