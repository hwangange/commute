<para id="fs-id1163758503353">The <link class="target-chapter" document="m58973">U.S. Constitution</link>—in particular, the first ten amendments that form the Bill of Rights—protects the freedoms and rights of individuals. It does not limit this protection just to citizens or adults; instead, in most cases, the Constitution simply refers to “persons,” which over time has grown to mean that even children, visitors from other countries, and immigrants—permanent or temporary, legal or undocumented—enjoy the same freedoms when they are in the United States or its territories as adult citizens do. So, whether you are a Japanese tourist visiting Disney World or someone who has stayed beyond the limit of days allowed on your visa, you do not sacrifice your liberties. In everyday conversation, we tend to treat freedoms, liberties, and rights as being effectively the same thing—similar to how separation of powers and checks and balances are often used as if they are interchangeable, when in fact they are distinct concepts.</para>
<section id="fs-id1163758521306">
<title>DEFINING CIVIL LIBERTIES</title>
<para id="fs-id1163758498706">To be more precise in their language, political scientists and legal experts make a distinction between civil liberties and civil rights, even though the Constitution has been interpreted to protect both. We typically envision <term>civil liberties</term> as being limitations on government power, intended to protect freedoms that governments may not legally intrude on. For example, the First Amendment denies the government the power to prohibit “the free exercise” of religion; the states and the national government cannot forbid people to follow a religion of their choice, even if politicians and judges think the religion is misguided, blasphemous, or otherwise inappropriate. You are free to create your own religion and recruit followers to it (subject to the U.S. Supreme Court deeming it a religion), even if both society and government disapprove of its tenets. That said, the way you practice your religion may be regulated if it impinges on the rights of others. Similarly, the Eighth Amendment says the government cannot impose “cruel and unusual punishments” on individuals for their criminal acts. Although the definitions of <emphasis effect="italics">cruel</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">unusual</emphasis> have expanded over the years, as we will see later in this chapter, the courts have generally and consistently interpreted this provision as making it unconstitutional for government officials to torture suspects.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163758504770"><term>Civil rights</term>, on the other hand, are guarantees that government officials will treat people equally and that decisions will be made on the basis of merit rather than race, gender, or other personal characteristics. Because of the Constitution’s civil rights guarantee, it is unlawful for a school or university run by a state government to treat students differently based on their race, ethnicity, age, sex, or national origin. In the 1960s and 1970s, many states had separate schools where only students of a certain race or gender were able to study. However, the courts decided that these policies violated the civil rights of students who could not be admitted because of those rules.<cite target-id="rf-12341"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-12341"><emphasis effect="italics">Green v.

<para id="fs-id1163758390125">The idea that Americans—indeed, people in general—have fundamental rights and liberties was at the core of the arguments in favor of their independence. In writing the <link class="target-chapter" document="m58972">Declaration of Independence</link> in 1776, Thomas <term class="no-emphasis">Jefferson</term> drew on the ideas of John <term class="no-emphasis">Locke</term> to express the colonists’ belief that they had certain inalienable or natural rights that no ruler had the power or authority to deny to his or her subjects. It was a scathing legal indictment of King George III for violating the colonists’ liberties. Although the Declaration of Independence does not guarantee specific freedoms, its language was instrumental in inspiring many of the states to adopt protections for civil liberties and rights in their own constitutions, and in expressing principles of the founding era that have resonated in the United States since its independence. In particular, Jefferson’s words “all men are created equal” became the centerpiece of struggles for the rights of women and minorities (<link target-id="OSC_AmGov_04_01_Equal"/>).</para>

<title>CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE CONSTITUTION</title>
<para id="fs-id1163758529444">The <term class="no-emphasis">Constitution</term> as written in 1787 did not include a <term class="no-emphasis">Bill of Rights</term>, although the idea of including one was proposed and, after brief discussion, dismissed in the final week of the Constitutional Convention. The framers of the Constitution believed they faced much more pressing concerns than the protection of civil rights and liberties, most notably keeping the fragile union together in the light of internal unrest and external threats.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163758654283">Moreover, the framers thought that they had adequately covered rights issues in the main body of the document. Indeed, the Federalists did include in the Constitution some protections against legislative acts that might restrict the liberties of citizens, based on the history of real and perceived abuses by both British kings and parliaments as well as royal governors. In <term class="no-emphasis">Article I</term>, Section 9, the Constitution limits the power of Congress in three ways: prohibiting the passage of bills of attainder, prohibiting ex post facto laws, and limiting the ability of Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163758666231">A <term class="no-emphasis">bill of attainder</term> is a law that convicts or punishes someone for a crime without a trial, a tactic used fairly frequently in England against the king’s enemies. Prohibition of such laws means that the U.S. Congress cannot simply punish people who are unpopular or seem to be guilty of crimes. An <term class="no-emphasis">ex post facto law</term> has a retroactive effect: it can be used to punish crimes that were not crimes at the time they were committed, or it can be used to increase the severity of punishment after the fact.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163758327308">Finally, the writ of <term class="no-emphasis">habeas corpus</term> is used in our common-law legal system to demand that a neutral judge decide whether someone has been lawfully detained. Particularly in times of war, or even in response to threats against national security, the government has held suspected enemy agents without access to civilian courts, often without access to lawyers or a defense, seeking instead to try them before military tribunals or detain them indefinitely without trial. For example, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln detained suspected Confederate saboteurs and sympathizers in Union-controlled states and attempted to have them tried in <term class="no-emphasis">military court</term>s, leading the Supreme Court to rule in <emphasis effect="italics">Ex parte Milligan</emphasis> that the government could not bypass the civilian court system in states where it was operating.<cite target-id="rf-12342"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-12342"><emphasis effect="italics">Ex parte Milligan</emphasis>, 71 U.S. 2 (1866).</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-id1163758580326">During World War II, the Roosevelt administration interned Japanese Americans and had other suspected enemy agents—including U.S. citizens—tried by military courts rather than by the civilian justice system, a choice the Supreme Court upheld in <emphasis effect="italics">Ex parte Quirin</emphasis> (<link target-id="OSC_AmGov_04_01_NazisWWII"/>).<cite target-id="rf-12343"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-12343"><emphasis effect="italics">Ex parte Quirin</emphasis>, 317 U.S. 1 (1942); See William H. Rehnquist. 1998. <emphasis effect="italics">All the Laws but One: Civil Liberties in Wartime</emphasis>. New York: William Morrow.</note></cite> More recently, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Bush and Obama administrations detained suspected terrorists captured both within and outside the United States and sought, with mixed results, to avoid trials in civilian courts. Hence, there have been times in our history when national security issues trumped individual liberties.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-id1163756085955">Debate has always swirled over these issues. The <term class="no-emphasis">Federalists</term> reasoned that the limited set of enumerated powers of Congress, along with the limitations on those powers in <term class="no-emphasis">Article I</term>, Section 9, would suffice, and no separate bill of rights was needed. Alexander <term class="no-emphasis">Hamilton</term>, writing as Publius in <emphasis effect="italics">Federalist</emphasis> No. 84, argued that the Constitution was “merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation,” rather than to concern itself with “the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns.” Hamilton went on to argue that listing some rights might actually be dangerous, because it would provide a pretext for people to claim that rights <emphasis effect="italics">not</emphasis> included in such a list were not protected. Later, James <term class="no-emphasis">Madison</term>, in his speech introducing the proposed amendments that would become the Bill of Rights, acknowledged another Federalist argument: “It has been said, that a bill of rights is not necessary, because the establishment of this government has not repealed those declarations of rights which are added to the several state constitutions.”<cite target-id="rf-12344"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-12344">American History from Revolution to Reconstruction and Beyond, “Madison Speech Proposing the Bill of Rights June 8 1789,” http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1786-1800/madison-speech-proposing-the-bill-of-rights-june-8-1789.php (March 4, 2016).</note></cite> For that matter, the Articles of Confederation had not included a specific listing of rights either.</para>
<para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="fs-id1163758378331">However, the <term class="no-emphasis">Anti-Federalists</term> argued that the Federalists’ position was incorrect and perhaps even insincere. The Anti-Federalists believed provisions such as the elastic clause in Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution would allow Congress to legislate on matters well beyond the limited ones foreseen by the Constitution’s authors; thus, they held that a bill of rights was necessary. One of the Anti-Federalists, <term class="no-emphasis">Brutus</term>, whom most scholars believe to be Robert <term class="no-emphasis">Yates</term>, wrote: “The powers, rights, and authority, granted to the general government by this Constitution, are as complete, with respect to every object to which they extend, as that of any state government—It reaches to every thing which concerns human happiness—Life, liberty, and property, are under its controul [sic]. There is the same reason, therefore, that the exercise of power, in this case, should be restrained within proper limits, as in that of the state governments.”<cite target-id="rf-12345"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-12345">Constitution Society, “To the Citizens of the State of New-York,” http://www.constitution.org/afp/brutus02.htm (March 4, 2016).</note></cite> The experience of the past two centuries has suggested that the Anti-Federalists may have been correct in this regard; while the states retain a great deal of importance, the scope and powers of the national government are much broader today than in 1787—likely beyond even the imaginings of the Federalists themselves.</para><para id="fs-id1163758363645">The struggle to have rights clearly delineated and the decision of the framers to omit a bill of rights nearly derailed the ratification process. While some of the states were willing to ratify without any further guarantees, in some of the larger states—New York and Virginia in particular—the Constitution’s lack of specified rights became a serious point of contention. The Constitution could go into effect with the support of only nine states, but the Federalists knew it could not be effective without the participation of the largest states. To secure majorities in favor of ratification in New York and Virginia, as well as Massachusetts, they agreed to consider incorporating provisions suggested by the ratifying states as amendments to the Constitution.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163758461416">Ultimately, James Madison delivered on this promise by proposing a package of amendments in the First Congress, drawing from the Declaration of Rights in the Virginia state constitution, suggestions from the ratification conventions, and other sources, which were extensively debated in both houses of Congress and ultimately proposed as twelve separate amendments for ratification by the states. Ten of the amendments were successfully ratified by the requisite 75 percent of the states and became known as the <term class="no-emphasis">Bill of Rights</term> (<link target-id="fs-id1163758489712"/>).</para>

<title>Debating the Need for a Bill of Rights</title>
<para id="fs-id1163758491610">One of the most serious debates between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists was over the necessity of limiting the power of the new federal government with a Bill of Rights. As we saw in this section, the Federalists believed a Bill of Rights was unnecessary—and perhaps even dangerous to liberty, because it might invite violations of rights that weren’t included in it—while the Anti-Federalists thought the national government would prove adept at expanding its powers and influence and that citizens couldn’t depend on the good judgment of Congress alone to protect their rights.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163758341822">As George Washington’s call for a bill of rights in his first inaugural address suggested, while the Federalists ultimately had to add the Bill of Rights to the Constitution in order to win ratification, and the Anti-Federalists would soon be proved right that the national government might intrude on civil liberties. In 1798, at the behest of President John Adams during the Quasi-War with France, Congress passed a series of four laws collectively known as the Alien and Sedition Acts. These were drafted to allow the president to imprison or deport foreign citizens he believed were “dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States” and to restrict speech and newspaper articles that were critical of the federal government or its officials; the laws were primarily used against members and supporters of the opposition Democratic-Republican Party.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163758665838">State laws and constitutions protecting free speech and freedom of the press proved ineffective in limiting this new federal power. Although the courts did not decide on the constitutionality of these laws at the time, most scholars believe the Sedition Act, in particular, would be unconstitutional if it had remained in effect. Three of the four laws were repealed in the Jefferson administration, but one—the Alien Enemies Act—remains on the books today. Two centuries later, the issue of free speech and freedom of the press during times of international conflict remains a subject of public debate.</para>

<title>EXTENDING THE BILL OF RIGHTS TO THE STATES</title>
<para id="fs-id1163758408519">In the decades following the Constitution’s ratification, the <term class="no-emphasis">Supreme Court</term> declined to expand the Bill of Rights to curb the power of the states, most notably in the 1833 case of <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Barron v. Baltimore</emphasis></term>.<cite target-id="rf-12346"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-12346"><emphasis effect="italics">Barron v. Baltimore</emphasis>, 32 U.S. 243 (1833).</note></cite> In this case, which dealt with property rights under the <term class="no-emphasis">Fifth Amendment</term>, the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the Bill of Rights applied only to actions by the federal government. Explaining the court’s ruling, Chief Justice John <term class="no-emphasis">Marshall</term> wrote that it was incorrect to argue that “the Constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments; as well as against that which might be attempted by their [Federal] government.”</para>
<para id="fs-id1163758491068">In the wake of the Civil War, however, the prevailing thinking about the application of the Bill of Rights to the states changed. Soon after slavery was abolished by the <term class="no-emphasis">Thirteenth Amendment</term>, state governments—particularly those in the former Confederacy—began to pass “black codes” that restricted the rights of former slaves and effectively relegated them to second-class citizenship under their state laws and constitutions. Angered by these actions, members of the Radical Republican faction in Congress demanded that the laws be overturned. In the short term, they advocated suspending civilian government in most of the southern states and replacing politicians who had enacted the black codes. Their long-term solution was to propose two amendments to the Constitution to guarantee the rights of freed slaves on an equal standing with whites; these rights became the <term class="no-emphasis">Fourteenth Amendment</term>, which dealt with civil liberties and rights in general, and the <term class="no-emphasis">Fifteenth Amendment</term>, which protected the right to vote in particular (<link target-id="OSC_AmGov_04_01_Fourteenth"/>). But, the right to vote did not yet apply to women or to Native Americans.</para>

</figure>
<para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="fs-id1163758390677">With the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, civil liberties gained more clarification. First, the amendment says, “no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States,” which is a provision that echoes the privileges and immunities clause in <term class="no-emphasis">Article IV</term>, Section 2, of the original Constitution ensuring that states treat citizens of other states the same as their own citizens. (To use an example from today, the punishment for speeding by an out-of-state driver cannot be more severe than the punishment for an in-state driver). Legal scholars and the courts have extensively debated the meaning of this privileges or immunities clause over the years; some have argued that it was supposed to extend the entire <term class="no-emphasis">Bill of Rights</term> (or at least the first eight amendments) to the states, while others have argued that only some rights are extended. In 1999, Justice John Paul <term class="no-emphasis">Stevens</term>, writing for a majority of the Supreme Court, argued in <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Saenz v. Roe</emphasis></term> that the clause protects the right to travel from one state to another.<cite target-id="rf-12347"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-12347"><emphasis effect="italics">Saenz v. Roe</emphasis>, 526 U.S. 489 (1999).</note></cite> More recently, Justice Clarence <term class="no-emphasis">Thomas</term> argued in the 2010 <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">McDonald v. Chicago</emphasis></term> ruling that the individual right to bear arms applied to the states because of this clause.<cite target-id="rf-12348"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-12348"><emphasis effect="italics">McDonald v. Chicago</emphasis>, 561 U.S. 742 (2010).</note></cite></para><para id="fs-id1163756118277">The second provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that pertains to applying the Bill of Rights to the states is the <term>due process clause</term>, which says, “nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” This provision is similar to the Fifth Amendment in that it also refers to “due process,” a term that generally means people must be treated fairly and impartially by government officials (or with what is commonly referred to as substantive due process). Although the text of the provision does not mention rights specifically, the courts have held in a series of cases that it indicates there are certain fundamental liberties that cannot be denied by the states. For example, in <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Sherbert v. Verner</emphasis></term> (1963), the Supreme Court ruled that states could not deny unemployment benefits to an individual who turned down a job because it required working on the Sabbath.<cite target-id="rf-12349"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-12349"><emphasis effect="italics">Sherbert v. Verner</emphasis>, 374 U.S. 398 (1963).</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-id1163758392288">Beginning in 1897, the Supreme Court has found that various provisions of the Bill of Rights protecting these fundamental liberties must be upheld by the states, even if their state constitutions and laws do not protect them as fully as the Bill of Rights does—or at all. This means there has been a process of <term>selective incorporation</term> of the Bill of Rights into the practices of the states; in other words, the Constitution effectively inserts parts of the Bill of Rights into state laws and constitutions, even though it doesn’t do so explicitly. When cases arise to clarify particular issues and procedures, the Supreme Court decides whether state laws violate the Bill of Rights and are therefore unconstitutional.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163758521606">For example, under the <term class="no-emphasis">Fifth Amendment</term> a person can be tried in federal court for a felony—a serious crime—only after a grand jury issues an indictment indicating that it is reasonable to try the person for the crime in question. (A grand jury is a group of citizens charged with deciding whether there is enough evidence of a crime to prosecute someone.) But the Supreme Court has ruled that states don’t have to use grand juries as long as they ensure people accused of crimes are indicted using an equally fair process.</para>
<para id="fs-id1163758408632">Selective incorporation is an ongoing process. When the Supreme Court initially decided in 2008 that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms, it did not decide then that it was a fundamental liberty the states must uphold as well. It was only in the <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">McDonald v. Chicago</emphasis></term> case two years later that the Supreme Court incorporated the Second Amendment into state law. Another area in which the Supreme Court gradually moved to incorporate the Bill of Rights regards censorship and the Fourteenth Amendment. In <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Near v. Minnesota</emphasis></term> (1931), the Court disagreed with state courts regarding censorship and ruled it unconstitutional except in rare cases.<cite target-id="rf-123410"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-123410"><emphasis effect="italics">Near v. Minnesota</emphasis>, 283 U.S. 697 (1931).</note></cite></para>

<para id="fs-id1163758843711">The Bill of Rights is designed to protect the freedoms of individuals from interference by government officials. Originally these protections were applied only to actions by the national government; different sets of rights and liberties were protected by state constitutions and laws, and even when the rights themselves were the same, the level of protection for them often differed by definition across the states. Since the Civil War, as a result of the passage and ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment and a series of Supreme Court decisions, most of the Bill of Rights’ protections of civil liberties have been expanded to cover actions by state governments as well through a process of selective incorporation. Nonetheless there is still vigorous debate about what these rights entail and how they should be balanced against the interests of others and of society as a whole.</para>
