<p id="fs-id1171472273044">In what ways can the media affect society and government? The media&#8217;s primary duty is to present us with information and alert us when important events occur. This information may affect what we think and the actions we take. The media can also place pressure on government to act by signaling a need for intervention or showing that citizens want change. For these reasons, the quality of the media&#8217;s coverage matters.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1171472104896"><h3 data-type="title">MEDIA EFFECTS AND BIAS</h3>
<p id="fs-id1171470300182">Concerns about the effects of media on consumers and the existence and extent of media bias go back to the 1920s. Reporter and commentator Walter <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Lippmann</span> noted that citizens have limited personal experience with government and the world and posited that the media, through their stories, place ideas in citizens&#8217; minds. These ideas become part of the citizens&#8217; frame of reference and affect their decisions. Lippmann&#8217;s statements led to the <span data-type="term">hypodermic theory</span>, which argues that information is &#8220;shot&#8221; into the receiver&#8217;s mind and readily accepted.<a href="#rf-103" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-103">Walter Lippmann. 1922. <em data-effect="italics">Public Opinion.</em> http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/Lippman/contents.html (August 29, 2015).</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1171472212240">Yet studies in the 1930s and 1940s found that information was transmitted in two steps, with one person reading the news and then sharing the information with friends. People listened to their friends, but not to those with whom they disagreed. The newspaper&#8217;s effect was thus diminished through conversation. This discovery led to the <span data-type="term">minimal effects theory</span>, which argues the media have little effect on citizens and voters.<a href="#rf-104" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-104">Bernard Berelson, Paul Lazarsfeld, and William McPhee. 1954. <em data-effect="italics">Voting</em>. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</div></a> By the 1970s, a new idea, the <span data-type="term">cultivation theory</span>, hypothesized that media develop a person&#8217;s view of the world by presenting a perceived reality.<a href="#rf-105" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-105">George Gerbner, Larry Gross, Michael Morgan, Nancy Signorielli, and Marilyn Jackson-Beeck. 1979. &#8220;The Demonstration of Power: Violence Profile,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Journal of Communication 29, No.</em>10: 177&#8211;196.</div></a> What we see on a regular basis is our reality. Media can then set norms for readers and viewers by choosing what is covered or discussed.</p>
<p id="fs-id1171474409639">In the end, the consensus among observers is that media have some effect, even if the effect is subtle. This raises the question of how the media, even general newscasts, can affect citizens. One of the ways is through <span data-type="term">framing</span>: the creation of a narrative, or context, for a news story. The news often uses frames to place a story in a context so the reader understands its importance or relevance. Yet, at the same time, framing affects the way the reader or viewer processes the story.</p>
<p id="fs-id1171474442166"><em data-effect="italics">Episodic framing</em> occurs when a story focuses on isolated details or specifics rather than looking broadly at a whole issue. <em data-effect="italics">Thematic framing</em> takes a broad look at an issue and skips numbers or details. It looks at how the issue has changed over a long period of time and what has led to it. For example, a large, urban city is dealing with the problem of an increasing homeless population, and the city has suggested ways to improve the situation. If journalists focus on the immediate statistics, report the current percentage of homeless people, interview a few, and look at the city&#8217;s current investment in a homeless shelter, the coverage is episodic. If they look at homelessness as a problem increasing everywhere, examine the reasons people become homeless, and discuss the trends in cities&#8217; attempts to solve the problem, the coverage is thematic. Episodic frames may create more sympathy, while a thematic frame may leave the reader or viewer emotionally disconnected and less sympathetic (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_08_04_SyrRef" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="OSC_AmGov_08_04_SyrRef"><figcaption>Civil war in Syria has led many to flee the country, including this woman living in a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan in September 2015.

</div>
<p id="fs-id1171472223026">Framing can also affect the way we see race, socioeconomics, or other generalizations. For this reason, it is linked to <span data-type="term">priming</span>: when media coverage predisposes the viewer or reader to a particular perspective on a subject or issue. If a newspaper article focuses on unemployment, struggling industries, and jobs moving overseas, the reader will have a negative opinion about the economy. If then asked whether he or she approves of the president&#8217;s job performance, the reader is primed to say no. Readers and viewers are able to fight priming effects if they are aware of them or have prior information about the subject.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1171474295480"><h3 data-type="title">COVERAGE EFFECTS ON GOVERNANCE AND CAMPAIGNS</h3>
<p id="fs-id1171474428735">When it is spotty, the media&#8217;s coverage of campaigns and government can sometimes affect the way government operates and the success of candidates. In 1972, for instance, the McGovern-Fraser reforms created a voter-controlled primary system, so party leaders no longer pick the presidential candidates. Now the media are seen as kingmakers and play a strong role in influencing who will become the Democratic and Republican nominees in presidential elections. They can discuss the candidates&#8217; messages, vet their credentials, carry sound bites of their speeches, and conduct interviews. The candidates with the most media coverage build momentum and do well in the first few primaries and caucuses. This, in turn, leads to more media coverage, more momentum, and eventually a winning candidate. Thus, candidates need the media.</p>
<p id="fs-id1171474404365">In the 1980s, campaigns learned that tight control on candidate information created more favorable media coverage. In the presidential election of 1984, candidates Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush began using an issue-of-the-day strategy, providing quotes and material on only one topic each day. This strategy limited what journalists could cover because they had only limited quotes and sound bites to use in their reports. In 1992, both Bush&#8217;s and Bill Clinton&#8217;s campaigns maintained their carefully drawn candidate images by also limiting photographers and television journalists to photo opportunities at rallies and campaign venues. The constant control of the media became known as the &#8220;bubble,&#8221; and journalists were less effective when they were in the campaign&#8217;s bubble. Reporters complained this coverage was campaign advertising rather than journalism, and a new model emerged with the 1996 election.<a href="#rf-106" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-106">Elizabeth A. Skewes. 2007. <em data-effect="italics">Message Control: How News Is Made on the Presidential Campaign Trail</em>. Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 79.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1171474441732">Campaign coverage now focuses on the spectacle of the season, rather than providing information about the candidates. Colorful personalities, strange comments, lapse of memories, and embarrassing revelations are more likely to get air time than the candidates&#8217; issue positions. Donald <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Trump</span> may be the best example of shallower press coverage of a presidential election. Some argue that newspapers and news programs are limiting the space they allot to discussion of the campaigns.<a href="#rf-107" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-107">Stephen Farnsworth and S. Robert Lichter. 2012. &#8220;Authors&#8217; Response: Improving News Coverage in the 2012 Presidential Campaign and Beyond,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Politics &amp; Policy</em> 40, No. 4: 547&#8211;556.</div></a> Others argue that citizens want to see updates on the race and electoral drama, not boring issue positions or substantive reporting.<a href="#rf-108" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-108">&#8220;Early Media Coverage Focuses on Horse Race,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">PBS News Hour</em>, 12 June 2007.</div></a> It may also be that journalists have tired of the information games played by politicians and have taken back control of the news cycles.<a href="#rf-109" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-109">Stephen Ansolabehere, Roy Behr, and Shanto Iyengar. 1992. <em data-effect="italics">The Media Game: American Politics in the Television Age</em>. New York: Macmillan.</div></a> All these factors have likely led to the shallow press coverage we see today, sometimes dubbed <em data-effect="italics">pack journalism</em> because journalists follow one another rather than digging for their own stories. Television news discusses the strategies and blunders of the election, with colorful examples. Newspapers focus on polls. In an analysis of the 2012 election, Pew Research found that 64 percent of stories and coverage focused on campaign strategy. Only 9 percent covered domestic issue positions; 6 percent covered the candidates&#8217; public records; and, 1 percent covered their foreign policy positions.<a href="#rf-110" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-110">&#8220;Frames of Campaign Coverage,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Pew Research Center</em>, 23 April 2012, http://www.journalism.org/2012/04/23/frames-campaign-coverage.</div></a></p><p id="fs-id1171470262261">For better or worse, coverage of the candidates&#8217; statements get less air time on radio and television, and sound bites, or clips, of their speeches have become even shorter. In 1968, the average sound bite from Richard Nixon was 42.3 seconds, while a recent study of television coverage found that sound bites had decreased to only eight seconds in the 2004 election.<a href="#rf-111" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-111">Kiku Adatto. May 28, 1990. &#8220;The Incredible Shrinking Sound Bite,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">New Republic</em> 202, No. 22: 20&#8211;23.</div></a> The clips chosen to air were attacks on opponents 40 percent of the time. Only 30 percent contained information about the candidate&#8217;s issues or events. The study also found the news showed images of the candidates, but for an average of only twenty-five seconds while the newscaster discussed the stories.<a href="#rf-112" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-112">Erik Bucy and Maria Elizabeth Grabe. 2007. &#8220;Taking Television Seriously: A Sound and Image Bite Analysis of Presidential Campaign Coverage, 1992&#8211;2004,&#8221;<em data-effect="italics"> Journal of Communication</em> 57, No. 4: 652&#8211;675.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1171472412537">This study supports the argument that shrinking sound bites are a way for journalists to control the story and add their own analysis rather than just report on it.<a href="#rf-113" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-113">Craig Fehrman, &#8220;The Incredible Shrinking Sound Bite,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Boston Globe</em>, 2 January 2011, http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/01/02/the_incredible_shrinking_sound_bite/.</div></a> Candidates are given a few minutes to try to argue their side of an issue, but some say television focuses on the argument rather than on information. In 2004, Jon <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Stewart</span> of Comedy Central&#8217;s <em data-effect="italics">The Daily Show</em> began attacking the CNN program <em data-effect="italics">Crossfire</em> for being theater, saying the hosts engaged in reactionary and partisan arguing rather than true debating.<a href="#rf-114" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-114">&#8220;Crossfire: Jon Stewart&#8217;s America,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">CNN</em>, 15 October 2004, http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html. </div></a> Some of Stewart&#8217;s criticisms resonated, even with host Paul Begala, and <em data-effect="italics">Crossfire</em> was later pulled from the air.<a href="#rf-115" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-115">Paul Begala, &#8220;Begala: The day Jon Stewart blew up my show,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">CNN</em>, 12 February 2015.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1171474317465">The media&#8217;s discussion of campaigns has also grown negative. Although biased campaign coverage dates back to the period of the partisan press, the increase in the number of cable news stations has made the problem more visible. Stations like FOX News and MSNBC are overt in their use of bias in framing stories. During the 2012 campaign, seventy-one of seventy-four MSNBC stories about Mitt Romney were highly negative, while FOX News&#8217; coverage of Obama had forty-six out of fifty-two stories with negative information (<a href="#OSC_AmGov_08_04_Bias" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The major networks&#8212;ABC, CBS, and NBC&#8212;were somewhat more balanced, yet the overall coverage of both candidates tended to be negative.<a href="#rf-116" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-116">Pew Research Center: Journalism &amp; Media Staff, &#8220;Coverage of the Candidates by Media Sector and Cable Outlet,&#8221; 1 November 2012.</div></a></p>

<p id="fs-id1171474407496">Due in part to the lack of substantive media coverage, campaigns increasingly use social media to relay their message. Candidates can create their own sites and pages and try to spread news through supporters to the undecided. In 2012, both Romney and Obama maintained Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube accounts to provide information to voters. Yet, on social media, candidates still need to combat negativity, from both the opposition and supporters. Stories about Romney that appeared in the mainstream media were negative 38 percent of the time, while his coverage in Facebook news was negative 62 percent of the time and 58 percent of the time on Twitter.<a href="#rf-117" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-117">&#8220;Winning the Media Campaign 2012,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Pew Research </em>Center, 2 November 2012.</div></a> In the 2016 election cycle, both party nominees heavily used social media. Donald Trump&#8217;s scores of tweets became very prominent as he tweeted during Clinton&#8217;s convention acceptance speech and sometimes at all hours of the night. Clinton also used Twitter, but less so than Trump, though arguably staying better on message. Trump tended to rail on about topics and at one point was even drawn into a Twitter battle with Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Hillary Clinton also used Facebook for longer messages and imaging.</p><p id="fs-id1171472243124">Once candidates are in office, the chore of governing begins, with the added weight of media attention. Historically, if presidents were unhappy with their press coverage, they used personal and professional means to change its tone. Franklin D. Roosevelt, for example, was able to keep journalists from printing stories through gentleman&#8217;s agreements, loyalty, and the provision of additional information, sometimes off the record. The journalists then wrote positive stories, hoping to keep the president as a source. John F. Kennedy hosted press conferences twice a month and opened the floor for questions from journalists, in an effort to keep press coverage positive.<a href="#rf-118" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-118">Fred Greenstein. 2009. <em data-effect="italics">The Presidential Difference</em>.<em data-effect="italics"> </em>Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1171474311082">When presidents and other members of the White House are not forthcoming with information, journalists must press for answers. Dan Rather, a journalist for CBS, regularly sparred with presidents in an effort to get information. When Rather interviewed Richard Nixon about Vietnam and Watergate, Nixon was hostile and uncomfortable.<a href="#rf-119" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-119">&#8220;Dan Rather versus Richard Nixon, 1974,&#8221; YouTube video, :46, from the National Association of Broadcasters annual convention in Houston on March 19,1974, posted by &#8220;thecelebratedmisterk,&#8221; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGBLAKq8xwc (November 30, 2015); &#8220;&#8216;A Conversation With the President,&#8217; Interview With Dan Rather of the Columbia Broadcasting System,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">The American Presidency Project</em>, 2 January 1972, http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3351.</div></a> In a 1988 interview with then-vice president George H. W. Bush, Bush accused Rather of being argumentative about the possible cover-up of a secret arms sale with Iran:</p>
<p id="fs-id1171474407008">
<q id="fs-id1171474560951">Rather: I don&#8217;t want to be argumentative, Mr. Vice President.<div data-type="newline"><br/></div>

Bush: This is not a great night, because I want to talk about why I want to be president, why those 41 percent of the people are supporting me. And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to judge my whole career by a rehash of Iran. How would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York? <a href="#rf-120" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-120">Wolf Blitzer, &#8220;Dan Rather&#8217;s Stand,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">CNN</em>, 10 September 2004.</div></a>
</q>
</p>
<p id="fs-id1171474483724">Cabinet secretaries and other appointees also talk with the press, sometimes making for conflicting messages. The creation of the position of press secretary and the White House Office of Communications both stemmed from the need to send a cohesive message from the executive branch. Currently, the White House controls the information coming from the executive branch through the Office of Communications and decides who will meet with the press and what information will be given.</p>
<p id="fs-id1171472256138">But stories about the president often examine personality, or the president&#8217;s ability to lead the country, deal with Congress, or respond to national and international events. They are less likely to cover the president&#8217;s policies or agendas without a lot of effort on the president&#8217;s behalf.<a href="#rf-121" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-121">Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha and Jeffrey Peake. 2011. <em data-effect="italics">Breaking Through the Noise: Presidential Leadership, Public Opinion, and the News Media</em>.<em data-effect="italics"> </em>Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.</div></a> When Obama first entered office in 2009, journalists focused on his battles with Congress, critiquing his leadership style and inability to work with Representative Nancy Pelosi, then Speaker of the House. To gain attention for his policies, specifically the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</span> (ARRA), Obama began traveling the United States to draw the media away from Congress and encourage discussion of his economic stimulus package. Once the ARRA had been passed, Obama began travelling again, speaking locally about why the country needed the <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Affordable Care Act</span> and guiding media coverage to promote support for the act.<a href="#rf-122" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-122">Ibid.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1171472262931">Congressional representatives have a harder time attracting media attention for their policies. House and Senate members who use the media well, either to help their party or to show expertise in an area, may increase their power within Congress, which helps them bargain for fellow legislators&#8217; votes. Senators and high-ranking House members may also be invited to appear on cable news programs as guests, where they may gain some media support for their policies. Yet, overall, because there are so many members of Congress, and therefore so many agendas, it is harder for individual representatives to draw media coverage.<a href="#rf-123" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-123">Gary Lee Malecha and Daniel J. Reagan. 2011. <em data-effect="italics">The Public Congress: Congressional Deliberation in a New Media Age</em>. New York: Routledge.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1171474310583">It is less clear, however, whether media coverage of an issue leads Congress to make policy, or whether congressional policymaking leads the media to cover policy. In the 1970s, Congress investigated ways to stem the number of drug-induced deaths and crimes. As congressional meetings dramatically increased, the press was slow to cover the topic.

<p id="fs-id1171472272770">Later studies of the media&#8217;s effect on both the president and Congress report that the media has a stronger agenda-setting effect on the president than on Congress. What the media choose to cover affects what the president thinks is important to voters, and these issues were often of national importance. The media&#8217;s effect on Congress was limited, however, and mostly extended to local issues like education or child and elder abuse.<a href="#rf-125" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-125">George Edwards and Dan Wood. 1999. &#8220;Who Influences Whom?

<p id="fs-id1171474260609">The media choose what they want to discuss. This agenda setting creates a reality for voters and politicians that affects the way people think, act, and vote. Even if the crime rate is going down, for instance, citizens accustomed to reading stories about assault and other offenses still perceive crime to be an issue.<a href="#rf-126" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-126">Ally Fogg, &#8220;Crime Is Falling. Now Let&#8217;s Reduce Fear of Crime,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Guardian</em>, 24 April 24 2013.</div></a> Studies have also found that the media&#8217;s portrayal of race is flawed, especially in coverage of crime and poverty. One study revealed that local news shows were more likely to show pictures of criminals when they were African American, so they overrepresented blacks as perpetrators and whites as victims.<a href="#rf-127" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-127">Travis L. Dixon. 2008. &#8220;Crime News and Racialized Beliefs: Understanding the Relationship between Local News Viewing and Perceptions of African Americans and Crime,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Journal of Communication</em> 58, No. 1: 106&#8211;125.</div></a> A second study found a similar pattern in which Latinos were underrepresented as victims of crime and as police officers, while whites were overrepresented as both.<a href="#rf-128" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-128">Travis Dixon. 2015. &#8220;Good Guys Are Still Always in White?

<p id="fs-id1171472197170">Network news similarly misrepresents the victims of poverty by using more images of blacks than whites in its segments. Viewers in a study were left believing African Americans were the majority of the unemployed and poor, rather than seeing the problem as one faced by many races.<a href="#rf-129" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-129">Travis L.

A study of images printed in national magazines, like <em data-effect="italics">Time </em>and <em data-effect="italics">Newsweek</em>, found they also misrepresented race and poverty. The magazines were more likely to show images of young African Americans when discussing poverty and excluded the elderly and the young, as well as whites and Latinos, which is the true picture of poverty.<a href="#rf-130" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-130">Martin Gilens. 1996. &#8220;Race and Poverty in America: Public Misperceptions and the American News Media,&#8221; <em data-effect="italics">Public Opinion Quarterly </em>60, No. 4: 515&#8211;541.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1171474251606">Racial framing, even if unintentional, affects perceptions and policies. If viewers are continually presented with images of African Americans as criminals, there is an increased chance they will perceive members of this group as violent or aggressive.<a href="#rf-131" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-131">Dixon. &#8220;Crime News and Racialized Beliefs.&#8221;</div></a> The perception that most recipients of welfare are working-age African Americans may have led some citizens to vote for candidates who promised to reduce welfare benefits.<a href="#rf-132" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-132">Gilens. &#8220;Race and Poverty in America.&#8221;</div></a> When survey respondents were shown a story of a white unemployed individual, 71 percent listed unemployment as one of the top three problems facing the United States, while only 53 percent did so if the story was about an unemployed African American.<a href="#rf-133" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-133">Shanto Iyengar and Donald R. Kinder. 1987. <em data-effect="italics">News That Matters</em>. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</div></a></p>
<p id="fs-id1171472204943">Word choice may also have a priming effect. News organizations like the <em data-effect="italics">Los Angeles Times </em>and the Associated Press no longer use the phrase &#8220;illegal immigrant&#8221; to describe undocumented residents. This may be due to the desire to create a &#8220;sympathetic&#8221; frame for the immigration situation rather than a &#8220;threat&#8221; frame.<a href="#rf-134" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-134">Daniel C.

<p id="fs-id1171472159833">Media coverage of women has been similarly biased. Most journalists in the early 1900s were male, and women&#8217;s issues were not part of the newsroom discussion. As journalist Kay <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Mills</span> put it, the women&#8217;s movement of the 1960s and 1970s was about raising awareness of the problems of equality, but writing about rallies &#8220;was like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.&#8221;<a href="#rf-135" data-type="cite"><div data-type="note" class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-135">Kay Mills. 1996. &#8220;What Difference Do Women Journalists Make?&#8221; In <em data-effect="italics">Women, the Media and Politics</em>, ed.

<p id="fs-id1171474246826">In 1976, journalist Barbara <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Walters</span> became the first female coanchor on a network news show, <em data-effect="italics">The ABC Evening News</em>.

</div>
<p id="fs-id1171474404556">The media&#8217;s historically uneven coverage of women continues in its treatment of female candidates. Early coverage was sparse.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1171472394507" class="summary"><h3 data-type="title">Summary</h3>
<p id="fs-id1171474427308">Writers began to formally study media bias in the 1920s. Initially, the press was seen as being able to place information in our minds, but later research found that the media have a minimal effect on recipients. A more recent theory is that the media cultivates our reality by presenting information that creates our perceptions of the world. The media does have the ability to frame what it presents, and it can also prime citizens to think a particular way, which changes how they react to new information.</p>
<p id="fs-id1171474442665">The media&#8217;s coverage of electoral candidates has increasingly become analysis rather than reporting. Sound bites from candidates are shorter. The press now provides horse-race coverage on the campaigns rather than in-depth coverage on candidates and their positions, forcing voters to look for other sources, like social media, for information. Current coverage of the government focuses more on what the president does than on presidential policies. Congress, on the other hand, is rarely affected by the media. Most topics discussed by the media are already being discussed by members of Congress or its committees.</p>
<p id="fs-id1171472395147">The media frame discussions and choose pictures, information, and video to support stories, which may affect the way people vote on social policy and in elections.</p>
