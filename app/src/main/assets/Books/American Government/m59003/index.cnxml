<para id="fs-id1171472273044">In what ways can the media affect society and government? The media’s primary duty is to present us with information and alert us when important events occur. This information may affect what we think and the actions we take. The media can also place pressure on government to act by signaling a need for intervention or showing that citizens want change. For these reasons, the quality of the media’s coverage matters.</para>
<section id="fs-id1171472104896">
<title>MEDIA EFFECTS AND BIAS</title>
<para id="fs-id1171470300182">Concerns about the effects of media on consumers and the existence and extent of media bias go back to the 1920s. Reporter and commentator Walter <term class="no-emphasis">Lippmann</term> noted that citizens have limited personal experience with government and the world and posited that the media, through their stories, place ideas in citizens’ minds. These ideas become part of the citizens’ frame of reference and affect their decisions. Lippmann’s statements led to the <term>hypodermic theory</term>, which argues that information is “shot” into the receiver’s mind and readily accepted.<cite target-id="rf-103"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-103">Walter Lippmann. 1922. <emphasis effect="italics">Public Opinion.</emphasis> http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/Lippman/contents.html (August 29, 2015).</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-id1171472212240">Yet studies in the 1930s and 1940s found that information was transmitted in two steps, with one person reading the news and then sharing the information with friends. People listened to their friends, but not to those with whom they disagreed. The newspaper’s effect was thus diminished through conversation. This discovery led to the <term>minimal effects theory</term>, which argues the media have little effect on citizens and voters.<cite target-id="rf-104"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-104">Bernard Berelson, Paul Lazarsfeld, and William McPhee. 1954. <emphasis effect="italics">Voting</emphasis>. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</note></cite> By the 1970s, a new idea, the <term>cultivation theory</term>, hypothesized that media develop a person’s view of the world by presenting a perceived reality.<cite target-id="rf-105"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-105">George Gerbner, Larry Gross, Michael Morgan, Nancy Signorielli, and Marilyn Jackson-Beeck. 1979. “The Demonstration of Power: Violence Profile,” <emphasis effect="italics">Journal of Communication 29, No.</emphasis>10: 177–196.</note></cite> What we see on a regular basis is our reality. Media can then set norms for readers and viewers by choosing what is covered or discussed.</para>
<para id="fs-id1171474409639">In the end, the consensus among observers is that media have some effect, even if the effect is subtle. This raises the question of how the media, even general newscasts, can affect citizens. One of the ways is through <term>framing</term>: the creation of a narrative, or context, for a news story. The news often uses frames to place a story in a context so the reader understands its importance or relevance. Yet, at the same time, framing affects the way the reader or viewer processes the story.</para>
<para id="fs-id1171474442166"><emphasis effect="italics">Episodic framing</emphasis> occurs when a story focuses on isolated details or specifics rather than looking broadly at a whole issue. <emphasis effect="italics">Thematic framing</emphasis> takes a broad look at an issue and skips numbers or details. It looks at how the issue has changed over a long period of time and what has led to it. For example, a large, urban city is dealing with the problem of an increasing homeless population, and the city has suggested ways to improve the situation. If journalists focus on the immediate statistics, report the current percentage of homeless people, interview a few, and look at the city’s current investment in a homeless shelter, the coverage is episodic. If they look at homelessness as a problem increasing everywhere, examine the reasons people become homeless, and discuss the trends in cities’ attempts to solve the problem, the coverage is thematic. Episodic frames may create more sympathy, while a thematic frame may leave the reader or viewer emotionally disconnected and less sympathetic (<link target-id="OSC_AmGov_08_04_SyrRef"/>).</para>

</note>
<para id="fs-id1171472223026">Framing can also affect the way we see race, socioeconomics, or other generalizations. For this reason, it is linked to <term>priming</term>: when media coverage predisposes the viewer or reader to a particular perspective on a subject or issue. If a newspaper article focuses on unemployment, struggling industries, and jobs moving overseas, the reader will have a negative opinion about the economy. If then asked whether he or she approves of the president’s job performance, the reader is primed to say no. Readers and viewers are able to fight priming effects if they are aware of them or have prior information about the subject.</para>

<title>COVERAGE EFFECTS ON GOVERNANCE AND CAMPAIGNS</title>
<para id="fs-id1171474428735">When it is spotty, the media’s coverage of campaigns and government can sometimes affect the way government operates and the success of candidates. In 1972, for instance, the McGovern-Fraser reforms created a voter-controlled primary system, so party leaders no longer pick the presidential candidates. Now the media are seen as kingmakers and play a strong role in influencing who will become the Democratic and Republican nominees in presidential elections. They can discuss the candidates’ messages, vet their credentials, carry sound bites of their speeches, and conduct interviews. The candidates with the most media coverage build momentum and do well in the first few primaries and caucuses. This, in turn, leads to more media coverage, more momentum, and eventually a winning candidate. Thus, candidates need the media.</para>
<para id="fs-id1171474404365">In the 1980s, campaigns learned that tight control on candidate information created more favorable media coverage. In the presidential election of 1984, candidates Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush began using an issue-of-the-day strategy, providing quotes and material on only one topic each day. This strategy limited what journalists could cover because they had only limited quotes and sound bites to use in their reports. In 1992, both Bush’s and Bill Clinton’s campaigns maintained their carefully drawn candidate images by also limiting photographers and television journalists to photo opportunities at rallies and campaign venues. The constant control of the media became known as the “bubble,” and journalists were less effective when they were in the campaign’s bubble. Reporters complained this coverage was campaign advertising rather than journalism, and a new model emerged with the 1996 election.<cite target-id="rf-106"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-106">Elizabeth A. Skewes. 2007. <emphasis effect="italics">Message Control: How News Is Made on the Presidential Campaign Trail</emphasis>. Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 79.</note></cite></para>
<para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="fs-id1171474441732">Campaign coverage now focuses on the spectacle of the season, rather than providing information about the candidates. Colorful personalities, strange comments, lapse of memories, and embarrassing revelations are more likely to get air time than the candidates’ issue positions. Donald <term class="no-emphasis">Trump</term> may be the best example of shallower press coverage of a presidential election. Some argue that newspapers and news programs are limiting the space they allot to discussion of the campaigns.<cite target-id="rf-107"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-107">Stephen Farnsworth and S. Robert Lichter. 2012. “Authors’ Response: Improving News Coverage in the 2012 Presidential Campaign and Beyond,” <emphasis effect="italics">Politics &amp; Policy</emphasis> 40, No. 4: 547–556.</note></cite> Others argue that citizens want to see updates on the race and electoral drama, not boring issue positions or substantive reporting.<cite target-id="rf-108"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-108">“Early Media Coverage Focuses on Horse Race,” <emphasis effect="italics">PBS News Hour</emphasis>, 12 June 2007.</note></cite> It may also be that journalists have tired of the information games played by politicians and have taken back control of the news cycles.<cite target-id="rf-109"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-109">Stephen Ansolabehere, Roy Behr, and Shanto Iyengar. 1992. <emphasis effect="italics">The Media Game: American Politics in the Television Age</emphasis>. New York: Macmillan.</note></cite> All these factors have likely led to the shallow press coverage we see today, sometimes dubbed <emphasis effect="italics">pack journalism</emphasis> because journalists follow one another rather than digging for their own stories. Television news discusses the strategies and blunders of the election, with colorful examples. Newspapers focus on polls. In an analysis of the 2012 election, Pew Research found that 64 percent of stories and coverage focused on campaign strategy. Only 9 percent covered domestic issue positions; 6 percent covered the candidates’ public records; and, 1 percent covered their foreign policy positions.<cite target-id="rf-110"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-110">“Frames of Campaign Coverage,” <emphasis effect="italics">Pew Research Center</emphasis>, 23 April 2012, http://www.journalism.org/2012/04/23/frames-campaign-coverage.</note></cite></para><para id="fs-id1171470262261">For better or worse, coverage of the candidates’ statements get less air time on radio and television, and sound bites, or clips, of their speeches have become even shorter. In 1968, the average sound bite from Richard Nixon was 42.3 seconds, while a recent study of television coverage found that sound bites had decreased to only eight seconds in the 2004 election.<cite target-id="rf-111"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-111">Kiku Adatto. May 28, 1990. “The Incredible Shrinking Sound Bite,” <emphasis effect="italics">New Republic</emphasis> 202, No. 22: 20–23.</note></cite> The clips chosen to air were attacks on opponents 40 percent of the time. Only 30 percent contained information about the candidate’s issues or events. The study also found the news showed images of the candidates, but for an average of only twenty-five seconds while the newscaster discussed the stories.<cite target-id="rf-112"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-112">Erik Bucy and Maria Elizabeth Grabe. 2007. “Taking Television Seriously: A Sound and Image Bite Analysis of Presidential Campaign Coverage, 1992–2004,”<emphasis effect="italics"> Journal of Communication</emphasis> 57, No. 4: 652–675.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-id1171472412537">This study supports the argument that shrinking sound bites are a way for journalists to control the story and add their own analysis rather than just report on it.<cite target-id="rf-113"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-113">Craig Fehrman, “The Incredible Shrinking Sound Bite,” <emphasis effect="italics">Boston Globe</emphasis>, 2 January 2011, http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/01/02/the_incredible_shrinking_sound_bite/.</note></cite> Candidates are given a few minutes to try to argue their side of an issue, but some say television focuses on the argument rather than on information. In 2004, Jon <term class="no-emphasis">Stewart</term> of Comedy Central’s <emphasis effect="italics">The Daily Show</emphasis> began attacking the CNN program <emphasis effect="italics">Crossfire</emphasis> for being theater, saying the hosts engaged in reactionary and partisan arguing rather than true debating.<cite target-id="rf-114"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-114">“Crossfire: Jon Stewart’s America,” <emphasis effect="italics">CNN</emphasis>, 15 October 2004, http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html. </note></cite> Some of Stewart’s criticisms resonated, even with host Paul Begala, and <emphasis effect="italics">Crossfire</emphasis> was later pulled from the air.<cite target-id="rf-115"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-115">Paul Begala, “Begala: The day Jon Stewart blew up my show,” <emphasis effect="italics">CNN</emphasis>, 12 February 2015.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-id1171474317465">The media’s discussion of campaigns has also grown negative. Although biased campaign coverage dates back to the period of the partisan press, the increase in the number of cable news stations has made the problem more visible. Stations like FOX News and MSNBC are overt in their use of bias in framing stories. During the 2012 campaign, seventy-one of seventy-four MSNBC stories about Mitt Romney were highly negative, while FOX News’ coverage of Obama had forty-six out of fifty-two stories with negative information (<link target-id="OSC_AmGov_08_04_Bias"/>). The major networks—ABC, CBS, and NBC—were somewhat more balanced, yet the overall coverage of both candidates tended to be negative.<cite target-id="rf-116"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-116">Pew Research Center: Journalism &amp; Media Staff, “Coverage of the Candidates by Media Sector and Cable Outlet,” 1 November 2012.</note></cite></para>

<caption>Media coverage of campaigns is increasingly negative, with cable news stations demonstrating more bias in their framing of stories during the 2012 campaign.</caption>
</figure>
<para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="fs-id1171474407496">Due in part to the lack of substantive media coverage, campaigns increasingly use social media to relay their message. Candidates can create their own sites and pages and try to spread news through supporters to the undecided. In 2012, both Romney and Obama maintained Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube accounts to provide information to voters. Yet, on social media, candidates still need to combat negativity, from both the opposition and supporters. Stories about Romney that appeared in the mainstream media were negative 38 percent of the time, while his coverage in Facebook news was negative 62 percent of the time and 58 percent of the time on Twitter.<cite target-id="rf-117"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-117">“Winning the Media Campaign 2012,” <emphasis effect="italics">Pew Research </emphasis>Center, 2 November 2012.</note></cite> In the 2016 election cycle, both party nominees heavily used social media. Donald Trump’s scores of tweets became very prominent as he tweeted during Clinton’s convention acceptance speech and sometimes at all hours of the night. Clinton also used Twitter, but less so than Trump, though arguably staying better on message. Trump tended to rail on about topics and at one point was even drawn into a Twitter battle with Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Hillary Clinton also used Facebook for longer messages and imaging.</para><para id="fs-id1171472243124">Once candidates are in office, the chore of governing begins, with the added weight of media attention. Historically, if presidents were unhappy with their press coverage, they used personal and professional means to change its tone. Franklin D. Roosevelt, for example, was able to keep journalists from printing stories through gentleman’s agreements, loyalty, and the provision of additional information, sometimes off the record. The journalists then wrote positive stories, hoping to keep the president as a source. John F. Kennedy hosted press conferences twice a month and opened the floor for questions from journalists, in an effort to keep press coverage positive.<cite target-id="rf-118"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-118">Fred Greenstein. 2009. <emphasis effect="italics">The Presidential Difference</emphasis>.<emphasis effect="italics"> </emphasis>Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</note></cite></para>
<para id="fs-id1171474311082">When presidents and other members of the White House are not forthcoming with information, journalists must press for answers.

<para id="fs-id1171474260609">The media choose what they want to discuss. This agenda setting creates a reality for voters and politicians that affects the way people think, act, and vote.

<para id="fs-id1171472197170">Network news similarly misrepresents the victims of poverty by using more images of blacks than whites in its segments.

A study of images printed in national magazines, like <emphasis effect="italics">Time </emphasis>and <emphasis effect="italics">Newsweek</emphasis>, found they also misrepresented race and poverty.

<title>Summary</title>
<para id="fs-id1171474427308">Writers began to formally study media bias in the 1920s. Initially, the press was seen as being able to place information in our minds, but later research found that the media have a minimal effect on recipients. A more recent theory is that the media cultivates our reality by presenting information that creates our perceptions of the world. The media does have the ability to frame what it presents, and it can also prime citizens to think a particular way, which changes how they react to new information.</para>
<para id="fs-id1171474442665">The media’s coverage of electoral candidates has increasingly become analysis rather than reporting. Sound bites from candidates are shorter. The press now provides horse-race coverage on the campaigns rather than in-depth coverage on candidates and their positions, forcing voters to look for other sources, like social media, for information. Current coverage of the government focuses more on what the president does than on presidential policies. Congress, on the other hand, is rarely affected by the media. Most topics discussed by the media are already being discussed by members of Congress or its committees.</para>
<para id="fs-id1171472395147">The media frame discussions and choose pictures, information, and video to support stories, which may affect the way people vote on social policy and in elections.</para>
