        </figure><p id="import-auto-id1299070">What, exactly, is deviance? And what is the relationship between deviance and crime?  According to sociologist William Graham Sumner, <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2228571">deviance</span> is a violation of established contextual, cultural, or social norms, whether folkways, mores, or codified law (1906). It can be as minor as picking your nose in public or as major as committing murder. Although the word &#8220;deviance&#8221; has a negative connotation in everyday language, sociologists recognize that deviance is not necessarily bad (Schoepflin 2011). In fact, from a structural functionalist perspective, one of the positive contributions of deviance is that it fosters social change. For example, during the U.S. civil rights movement, Rosa Parks violated social norms when she refused to move to the &#8220;black section&#8221; of the bus, and the Little Rock Nine broke customs of segregation to attend an Arkansas public school.</p><p id="import-auto-id2858322">&#8220;What is deviant behavior?&#8221; cannot be answered in a straightforward manner. Whether an act is labeled deviant or not depends on many factors, including location, audience, and the individual committing the act (Becker 1963). Listening to your iPod on the way to class is considered acceptable behavior. Listening to your iPod during your 2 p.m. sociology lecture is considered rude. Listening to your iPod when on the witness stand before a judge may cause you to be held in contempt of court and consequently fined or jailed. </p><p id="import-auto-id2792730">As norms vary across culture and time, it makes sense that notions of deviance change also. Fifty years ago, public schools in the United States had strict dress codes that, among other stipulations, often banned women from wearing pants to class. Today, it&#8217;s socially acceptable for women to wear pants, but less so for men to wear skirts. In a time of war, acts usually considered morally reprehensible, such as taking the life of another, may actually be rewarded. Whether an act is deviant or not depends on society&#8217;s response to that act.</p>
<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id1330258" class="sociology-real-world" data-label=""><div data-type="title">Why I Drive a Hearse</div>
        <p id="import-auto-id2290830">When sociologist Todd Schoepflin ran into his childhood friend Bill, he was shocked to see him driving a hearse instead of an ordinary car. A professionally trained researcher, Schoepflin wondered what effect driving a hearse had on his friend and what effect it might have on others on the road. Would using such a vehicle for everyday errands be considered deviant by most people?</p><p id="import-auto-id1274793">Schoepflin interviewed Bill, curious first to know why he drove such an unconventional car. Bill had simply been on the lookout for a reliable winter car; on a tight budget, he searched used car ads and stumbled upon one for the hearse. The car ran well, and the price was right, so he bought it.</p><p id="import-auto-id3017214">Bill admitted that others&#8217; reactions to the car had been mixed. His parents were appalled, and he received odd stares from his coworkers. A mechanic once refused to work on it, and stated that it was &#8220;a dead person machine.&#8221; On the whole, however, Bill received mostly positive reactions. Strangers gave him a thumbs-up on the highway and stopped him in parking lots to chat about his car. His girlfriend loved it, his friends wanted to take it tailgating, and people offered to buy it. Could it be that driving a hearse isn&#8217;t really so deviant after all?</p><p id="import-auto-id1428082">Schoepflin theorized that, although viewed as outside conventional norms, driving a hearse is such a mild form of deviance that it actually becomes a mark of distinction. Conformists find the choice of vehicle intriguing or appealing, while nonconformists see a fellow oddball to whom they can relate. As one of Bill&#8217;s friends remarked, &#8220;Every guy wants to own a unique car like this, and <em data-effect="italics">you</em> can certainly pull it off.&#8221; Such anecdotes remind us that although deviance is often viewed as a violation of norms, it&#8217;s not always viewed in a negative light (Schoepflin 2011).</p><figure id="import-auto-id2274676"><figcaption>A hearse with the license plate &#8220;LASTRYD.&#8221; How would you view the owner of this car?

        <section data-depth="1" id="fs-id863824"><h3 data-type="title">Social Control</h3>
        <p id="import-auto-id2316644">When a person violates a social norm, what happens? A driver caught speeding can receive a speeding ticket. A student who wears a bathrobe to class gets a warning from a professor. An adult belching loudly is avoided. All societies practice <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2081360">social control</span>, the regulation and enforcement of norms. The underlying goal of social control is to maintain <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1329082">social order</span>, an arrangement of practices and behaviors on which society&#8217;s members base their daily lives. Think of social order as an employee handbook and social control as a manager. When a worker violates a workplace guideline, the manager steps in to enforce the rules; when an employee is doing an exceptionally good job at following the rules, the manager may praise or promote the employee.</p><p id="import-auto-id1662741">The means of enforcing rules are known as <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1313360">sanctions</span>. Sanctions can be positive as well as negative. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id786940">Positive sanctions</span> are rewards given for conforming to norms. A promotion at work is a positive sanction for working hard. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id3701064">Negative sanctions</span> are punishments for violating norms. Being arrested is a punishment for shoplifting. Both types of sanctions play a role in social control.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1395260">Sociologists also classify sanctions as formal or informal. Although shoplifting, a form of social deviance, may be illegal, there are no laws dictating the proper way to scratch your nose. That doesn&#8217;t mean picking your nose in public won&#8217;t be punished; instead, you will encounter <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2689677">informal sanctions</span>. Informal sanctions emerge in face-to-face social interactions. For example, wearing flip-flops to an opera or swearing loudly in church may draw disapproving looks or even verbal reprimands, whereas behavior that is seen as positive&#8212;such as helping an old man carry grocery bags across the street&#8212;may receive positive informal reactions, such as a smile or pat on the back.</p><p id="import-auto-id1221405"><span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id3117360">Formal sanctions</span>, on the other hand, are ways to officially recognize and enforce norm violations. If a student violates her college&#8217;s code of conduct, for example, she might be expelled. Someone who speaks inappropriately to the boss could be fired. Someone who commits a crime may be arrested or imprisoned. On the positive side, a soldier who saves a life may receive an official commendation. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2691703">The table below shows the relationship between different types of sanctions. </p>
 
       
        <table id="import-auto-id1351343" summary="A table displaying informal positive sanctions (an expression of thanks), formal positive sanctions (a promotion at work), informal negative sanctions (an angry comment), and formal negative sanctions (a parking fine)."><caption><span data-type="title">Informal/Formal Sanctions </span>Formal and informal sanctions may be positive or negative.
