While tensions were building over Ukraine's efforts to join the European Union, and even as Russian troops had taken control of the Ukrainian airbase in Belbek, the Odessa Philharmonic Orchestra and Opera Chorus tried to lighten the troubled times for shoppers with music and song.</p><p id="import-auto-id1406215">Spontaneous gatherings like this are called <span data-type="term">flash mobs</span>. They often are captured on video and shared on the Internet; frequently they go viral. Humans seek connections and shared experiences. Perhaps experiencing a flash mob event enhances this bond. It certainly interrupts our otherwise mundane routine with a reminder that we are social animals.</p></div>
        <section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2754585"><h3 data-type="title">Forms of Collective Behavior</h3>
            <p id="import-auto-id1948054">Flash mobs are examples of <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1824891">collective behavior</span>, noninstitutionalized activity in which several or many people voluntarily engage. Other examples are a group of commuters traveling home from work and a population of teens adopting a favorite singer&#8217;s hairstyle. In short, collective behavior is any group behavior that is not mandated or regulated by an institution. There are three primary forms of collective behavior: the crowd, the mass, and the public.</p><p id="import-auto-id1491184">It takes a fairly large number of people in close proximity to form a <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2323637">crowd</span> (Lofland 1993). Examples include a group of people attending an Ani DiFranco concert, tailgating at a Patriots game, or attending a worship service. Turner and Killian (1993) identified four types of crowds. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1586816">Casual crowds</span><strong data-effect="bold"/> consist of people who are in the same place at the same time but who aren&#8217;t really interacting, such as people standing in line at the post office. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1328907">Conventional crowds</span> are those who come together for a scheduled event that occurs regularly, like a religious service. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2388630">Expressive crowds</span> are people who join together to express emotion, often at funerals, weddings, or the like. The final type, <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1487890">acting crowds</span><strong data-effect="bold">, </strong>focuses on a specific goal or action, such as a protest movement or riot.</p><p id="import-auto-id1300875">In addition to the different types of crowds, collective groups can also be identified in two other ways. A <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1681945">mass</span> is a relatively large number of people with a common interest, though they may not be in close proximity (Lofland 1993), such as players of the popular Facebook game Farmville. A <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1773358">public</span>, on the other hand, is an unorganized, relatively diffused group of people who share ideas, such as the Libertarian political party. While these two types of crowds are similar, they are not the same. To distinguish between them, remember that members of a mass share interests, whereas members of a public share ideas.</p></section>

            <p id="import-auto-id2764478">Early collective behavior theories (LeBon 1895; Blumer 1969) focused on the irrationality of crowds. Eventually, those theorists who viewed crowds as uncontrolled groups of irrational people were supplanted by theorists who viewed the behavior some crowds engaged in as the rational behavior of logical beings.</p>

                <figure id="import-auto-id2693003"><figcaption>According to the emergent-norm perspective, Hurricane Katrina victims sought needed supplies for survival, but to outsiders their behavior would normally be seen as looting.

                </span>
                    </figure><p id="import-auto-id780670">Sociologists Ralph Turner and Lewis Killian (1993) built on earlier sociological ideas and developed what is known as emergent norm theory. They believe that the norms experienced by people in a crowd may be disparate and fluctuating. They emphasize the importance of these norms in shaping crowd behavior, especially those norms that shift quickly in response to changing external factors. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1038078">Emergent norm theory</span> <strong data-effect="bold"/>asserts that, in this circumstance, people perceive and respond to the crowd situation with their particular (individual) set of norms, which may change as the crowd experience evolves. This focus on the individual component of interaction reflects a symbolic interactionist perspective.</p><p id="import-auto-id2870576">For Turner and Killian, the process begins when individuals suddenly find themselves in a new situation, or when an existing situation suddenly becomes strange or unfamiliar. For example, think about human behavior during Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans was decimated and people were trapped without supplies or a way to evacuate. In these extraordinary circumstances, what outsiders saw as &#8220;looting&#8221; was defined by those involved as seeking needed supplies for survival. Normally, individuals would not wade into a corner gas station and take canned goods without paying, but given that they were suddenly in a greatly changed situation, they established a norm that they felt was reasonable.</p>
                <p id="import-auto-id2081154">Once individuals find themselves in a situation ungoverned by previously established norms, they interact in small groups to develop new guidelines on how to behave. According to the emergent-norm perspective, crowds are not viewed as irrational, impulsive, uncontrolled groups. Instead, norms develop and are accepted as they fit the situation. While this theory offers insight into why norms develop, it leaves undefined the nature of norms, how they come to be accepted by the crowd, and how they spread through the crowd.</p>

                <p id="import-auto-id2881107">Neil Smelser&#8217;s (1962) meticulous categorization of crowd behavior, called <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2624702">value-added theory</span><strong data-effect="bold">, </strong>is a perspective within the functionalist tradition based on the idea that several conditions must be in place for collective behavior to occur. Each condition adds to the likelihood that collective behavior will occur. The first condition is <em data-effect="italics">structural conduciveness</em><em data-effect="italics">,</em> which occurs when people are aware of the problem and have the opportunity to gather, ideally in an open area. <em data-effect="italics">Structural strain</em>, the second condition, refers to people&#8217;s expectations about the situation at hand being unmet, causing tension and strain. The next condition is the <em data-effect="italics">growth and spread of a generalized belief</em>, wherein a problem is clearly identified and attributed to a person or group. </p><p id="import-auto-id2400870">Fourth, <em data-effect="italics">precipitating factors</em> spur collective behavior; this is the emergence of a dramatic event. The fifth condition is <em data-effect="italics">mobilization for action</em>, when leaders emerge to direct a crowd to action. The final condition relates to action by the agents. Called <em data-effect="italics">social control</em>, it is the only way to end the collective behavior episode (Smelser 1962).</p><p id="import-auto-id1199892">A real-life example of these conditions occurred after the fatal police shooting of teenager Michael Brown, an unarmed eighteen-year-old African American, in Ferguson, MO on August 9, 2014. The shooting drew national attention almost immediately. A large group of mostly black, local residents assembled in protest&#8212;a classic example of structural conduciveness. When the community perceived that the police were not acting in the people's interest and were withholding the name of the officer, structural strain became evident. A growing generalized belief evolved as the crowd of protesters were met with heavily armed police in military-style protective uniforms accompanied by an armored vehicle. The precipitating factor of the arrival of the police spurred greater collective behavior as the residents mobilized by assembling a parade down the street. Ultimately they were met with tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets used by the police acting as agents of social control. The element of social control escalated over the following days until August 18, when the governor called in the National Guard.

Unlike previous theories, this theory refocuses attention from collective behavior to collective action. Remember that collective behavior is a noninstitutionalized gathering, whereas collective action is based on a shared interest. McPhail&#8217;s theory focused primarily on the processes associated with crowd behavior, plus the lifecycle of gatherings.

            <p id="import-auto-id1845465">Collective behavior is noninstitutionalized activity in which several people voluntarily engage. There are three different forms of collective behavior: crowd, mass, and public. There are three main theories on collective behavior. The first, the emergent-norm perspective, emphasizes the importance of social norms in crowd behavior. The next, the value-added theory, is a functionalist perspective that states that several preconditions must be in place for collective behavior to occur. Finally the assembling perspective focuses on collective action rather than collective behavior, addressing the processes associated with crowd behavior and the lifecycle and various categories of gatherings.</p></section>
