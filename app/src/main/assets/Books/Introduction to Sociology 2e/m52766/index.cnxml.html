    </figure><p id="import-auto-id2318371">Sociologists study social events, interactions, and patterns, and they develop a theory in an attempt to explain why things work as they do. In sociology, a <span data-type="term">theory</span> is a way to explain different aspects of social interactions and to create a testable proposition, called a <span data-type="term">hypothesis,</span> about society (Allan 2006).
</p><p id="import-auto-id2875826">For example, although suicide is generally considered an individual phenomenon, &#201;mile Durkheim was interested in studying the social factors that affect it. His studied social ties within a group, or <span data-type="term">social solidarity</span>, and hypothesized that differences in suicide rates might be explained by religion-based differences. Durkheim gathered a large amount of data about Europeans who had ended their lives, and he did indeed find differences based on religion. Protestants were more likely to commit suicide than Catholics in Durkheim&#8217;s society, and his work supports the utility of theory in sociological research.</p><p id="import-auto-id2269425">Theories vary in scope depending on the scale of the issues that they are meant to explain. Macro-level theories relate to large-scale issues and large groups of people, while micro-level theories look at very specific relationships between individuals or small groups. <span data-type="term">Grand theories</span> attempt to explain large-scale relationships and answer fundamental questions such as why societies form and why they change. Sociological theory is constantly evolving and should never be considered complete. Classic sociological theories are still considered important and current, but new sociological theories build upon the work of their predecessors and add to them (Calhoun 2002).</p><p id="import-auto-id2014959">In sociology, a few theories provide broad perspectives that help explain many different aspects of social life, and these are called paradigms. <span data-type="term">Paradigms</span> are philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within a discipline to formulate theories, generalizations, and the experiments performed in support of them. Three  paradigms have come to dominate sociological thinking, because they provide useful explanations: structural functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism.

    <p id="import-auto-id2768417"><span data-type="term">Functionalism</span>, also called structural-functional theory, sees society as a structure with interrelated parts designed to meet the biological and social needs of the individuals in that society. Functionalism grew out of the writings of English philosopher and biologist, Hebert Spencer (1820&#8211;1903), who saw similarities between society and the human body; he argued that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning, the various parts of society work together to keep society functioning (Spencer 1898). The parts of society that Spencer referred to were the <span data-type="term">social institutions,</span> or patterns of beliefs and behaviors focused on meeting social needs, such as government, education, family, healthcare, religion, and the economy. 
</p><p id="import-auto-id1347997">&#201;mile Durkheim, another early sociologist, applied Spencer&#8217;s theory to explain how societies change and survive over time. Durkheim believed that society is a complex system of interrelated and interdependent parts that work together to maintain stability (Durkheim 1893), and that society is held together by shared values, languages, and symbols. He believed that to study society, a sociologist must look beyond individuals to social facts such as laws, morals, values, religious beliefs, customs, fashion, and rituals, which all serve to govern social life. Alfred Radcliffe-Brown (1881&#8211;1955) defined the <span data-type="term">function</span> of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as a whole, and therefore the contribution it makes to social stability and continuity (Radcliffe-Brown 1952). In a healthy society, all parts work together to maintain stability, a state called <span data-type="term">dynamic equilibrium</span> by later sociologists such as Parsons (1961).
</p><p id="import-auto-id784416">Durkheim believed that individuals may make up society, but in order to study society, sociologists have to look beyond individuals to social facts. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1364072">Social facts</span> are the laws, morals, values, religious beliefs, customs, fashions, rituals, and all of the cultural rules that govern social life (Durkheim 1895). Each of these social facts serves one or more functions within a society. For example, one function of a society&#8217;s laws may be to protect society from violence, while another is to punish criminal behavior, while another is to preserve public health.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1474050">Another noted structural functionalist, Robert Merton (1910&#8211;2003), pointed out that social processes often have many functions. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1409966">Manifest functions</span> are the consequences of a social process that are sought or anticipated, while <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2747597">latent functions</span> are the unsought consequences of a social process. A manifest function of college education, for example, includes gaining knowledge, preparing for a career, and finding a good job that utilizes that education. Latent functions of your college years include meeting new people, participating in extracurricular activities, or even finding a spouse or partner. Another latent function of education is creating a hierarchy of employment based on the level of education attained. Latent functions can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful. Social processes that have undesirable consequences for the operation of society are called <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2647607">dysfunctions</span>. In education, examples of dysfunction include getting bad grades, truancy, dropping out, not graduating, and not finding suitable employment.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1336318"><h4 data-type="title">Criticism</h4>
    <p id="import-auto-id2648407">One criticism of the structural-functional theory is that it can&#8217;t adequately explain social change. Also problematic is the somewhat circular nature of this theory; repetitive behavior patterns are assumed to have a function, yet we profess to know that they have a function only because they are repeated. Furthermore, dysfunctions may continue, even though they don&#8217;t serve a function, which seemingly contradicts the basic premise of the theory. Many sociologists now believe that functionalism is no longer useful as a macro-level theory, but that it does serve a useful purpose in some mid-level analyses.

      </span>
    </figure><p id="import-auto-id1587798">Sociologists around the world look closely for signs of what would be an unprecedented event: the emergence of a global culture. In the past, empires such as those that existed in China, Europe, Africa, and Central and South America linked people from many different countries, but those people rarely became part of a common culture. They lived too far from each other, spoke different languages, practiced different religions, and traded few goods. Today, increases in communication, travel, and trade have made the world a much smaller place. More and more people are able to communicate with each other instantly&#8212;wherever they are located&#8212;by telephone, video, and text. They share movies, television shows, music, games, and information over the Internet. Students can study with teachers and pupils from the other side of the globe. Governments find it harder to hide conditions inside their countries from the rest of the world.</p><p id="import-auto-id1371542">Sociologists research many different aspects of this potential global culture. Some explore the dynamics involved in the social interactions of global online communities, such as when members feel a closer kinship to other group members than to people residing in their own countries. Other sociologists study the impact this growing international culture has on smaller, less-powerful local cultures. Yet other researchers explore how international markets and the outsourcing of labor impact social inequalities. Sociology can play a key role in people's abilities to understand the nature of this emerging global culture and how to respond to it.</p></div></section>

 <section data-depth="1" id="fs-id3081420"><h3 data-type="title">Conflict Theory</h3><p id="eip-id1169308794138"><span data-type="term">Conflict theory</span> looks at society as a competition for limited resources.  This perspective is a macro-level approach most identified with the writings of German philosopher and sociologist Karl Marx (1818&#8211;1883), who saw society as being made up of individuals in different social classes who must compete for social, material, and political resources such as food and housing, employment, education, and leisure time. Social institutions like government, education, and religion reflect this competition in their inherent inequalities and help maintain the unequal social structure. Some individuals and organizations are able to obtain and keep more resources than others, and these &#8220;winners&#8221; use their power and influence to maintain social institutions. Several theorist suggested variations on this basic theme. 
</p><p id="eip-id1169308771648">
Polish-Austrian sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz (1838&#8211;1909) expanded on Marx&#8217;s ideas by arguing that war and conquest are the basis of civilizations. He believed that cultural and ethnic conflicts led to states being identified and defined by a dominant group that had power over other groups (Irving 2007).  
</p><p id="eip-id1169308792940">
German sociologist Max Weber agreed with Marx but also believed that, in addition to economic inequalities, inequalities of political power and social structure cause conflict. Weber noted that different groups were affected differently based on education, race, and gender, and that people&#8217;s reactions to inequality were moderated by class differences and rates of social mobility, as well as by perceptions about the legitimacy of those in power. 
</p><p id="eip-id1169308789640">
German sociologist Georg Simmel (1858&#8211;1918) believed that conflict can help integrate and stabilize a society. He said that the intensity of the conflict varies depending on the emotional involvement of the parties, the degree of solidarity within the opposing groups, and the clarity and limited nature of the goals. Simmel also showed that groups work to create internal solidarity, centralize power, and reduce dissent. Resolving conflicts can reduce tension and hostility and can pave the way for future agreements. 
</p><p id="eip-id1169308765893">
In the 1930s and 1940s, German philosophers, known as the Frankfurt School, developed critical theory as an elaboration on Marxist principles.  Critical theory is an expansion of conflict theory and is broader than just sociology, including other social sciences and philosophy. A critical theory attempts to address structural issues causing inequality; it must explain what&#8217;s wrong in current social reality, identify the people who can make changes, and provide practical goals for social transformation (Horkeimer 1982).
</p><p id="eip-id1169308782047">
More recently, inequality based on gender or race has been explained in a similar manner and has identified institutionalized power structures that help to maintain inequality between groups. Janet Saltzman Chafetz (1941&#8211;2006) presented a model of feminist theory that attempts to explain the forces that maintain gender inequality as well as a theory of how such a system can be changed (Turner 2003). Similarly, critical race theory grew out of a critical analysis of race and racism from a legal point of view. Critical race theory looks at structural inequality based on white privilege and associated wealth, power, and prestige. </p>

<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="eip-169" class="sociology-real-world" data-label=""><div data-type="title">Farming and Locavores: How Sociological Perspectives Might View Food Consumption</div>
    <p id="import-auto-id2651699">The consumption of food is a commonplace, daily occurrence, yet it can also be associated with important moments in our lives. Eating can be an individual or a group action, and eating habits and customs are influenced by our cultures. In the context of society, our nation&#8217;s food system is at the core of numerous social movements, political issues, and economic debates. Any of these factors might become a topic of sociological study.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1681691">A structural-functional approach to the topic of food consumption might be interested in the role of the agriculture industry within the nation&#8217;s economy and how this has changed from the early days of manual-labor farming to modern mechanized production. Another examination might study the different functions that occur in food production: from farming and harvesting to flashy packaging and mass consumerism.</p>
    <p id="import-auto-id1682883">A conflict theorist might be interested in the power differentials present in the regulation of food, by exploring where people&#8217;s right to information intersects with corporations&#8217; drive for profit and how the government mediates those interests. Or a conflict theorist might be interested in the power and powerlessness experienced by local farmers versus large farming conglomerates, such as the documentary <em data-effect="italics">Food Inc.</em> depicts as resulting from Monsanto&#8217;s patenting of seed technology. Another topic of study might be how nutrition varies between different social classes.</p><p id="import-auto-id834520">A sociologist viewing food consumption through a symbolic interactionist lens would be more interested in micro-level topics, such as the symbolic use of food in religious rituals, or the role it plays in the social interaction of a family dinner. This perspective might also study the interactions among group members who identify themselves based on their sharing a particular diet, such as vegetarians (people who don&#8217;t eat meat) or locavores (people who strive to eat locally produced food).</p>
</div>
<p id="eip-id1171759580175">Just as structural functionalism was criticized for focusing too much on the stability of societies,
conflict theory has been criticized because it tends to focus on conflict to the exclusion of recognizing stability. Many social structures are extremely stable or have gradually progressed over time rather than changing abruptly as conflict theory would suggest.</p></section></section><section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2109775"><h3 data-type="title">Symbolic Interactionist Theory</h3><p id="import-auto-id2269321"><span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2621869">Symbolic interactionism</span> is a micro-level theory that focuses on the relationships among individuals within a society. Communication&#8212;the exchange of meaning through language and symbols&#8212;is believed to be the way in which people make sense of their social worlds. Theorists Herman and Reynolds (1994) note that this perspective sees people as being active in shaping the social world rather than simply being acted upon.
</p><p id="import-auto-id1409083">George Herbert Mead (1863&#8211;1931) is considered a founder of symbolic interactionism though he never published his work on it (LaRossa and Reitzes 1993). Mead&#8217;s student, Herbert Blumer, coined the term &#8220;symbolic interactionism&#8221; and outlined these basic premises: humans interact with things based on meanings ascribed to those things; the ascribed meaning of things comes from our interactions with others and society; the meanings of things are interpreted by a person when dealing with things in specific circumstances (Blumer 1969). If you love books, for example, a symbolic interactionist might propose that you learned that books are good or important in the interactions you had with family, friends, school, or church; maybe your family had a special reading time each week, getting your library card was treated as a special event, or bedtime stories were associated with warmth and comfort.</p><p id="import-auto-id2101681">Social scientists who apply symbolic-interactionist thinking look for patterns of interaction between individuals. Their studies often involve observation of one-on-one interactions. For example, while a conflict theorist studying a political protest might focus on class difference, a symbolic interactionist would be more interested in how individuals in the protesting group interact, as well as the signs and symbols protesters use to communicate their message. The focus on the importance of symbols in building a society led sociologists like Erving Goffman (1922&#8211;1982) to develop a technique called <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1428912">dramaturgical analysis</span>. Goffman used theater as an analogy for social interaction and recognized that people&#8217;s interactions showed patterns of cultural &#8220;scripts.&#8221; Because it can be unclear what part a person may play in a given situation, he or she has to improvise his or her role as the situation unfolds (Goffman 1958).</p><p id="import-auto-id2101043">Studies that use the symbolic interactionist perspective are more likely to use qualitative research methods, such as in-depth interviews or participant observation, because they seek to understand the symbolic worlds in which research subjects live. </p>
    <p id="eip-536"><span data-type="term">Constructivism</span> is an extension of symbolic interaction theory which proposes that reality is what humans cognitively construct it to be. We develop social constructs based on interactions with others, and those constructs that last over time are those that have meanings which are widely agreed-upon or generally accepted by most within the society. This approach is often used to understand what&#8217;s defined as deviant within a society. There is no absolute definition of deviance, and different societies have constructed  different meanings for deviance, as well as associating different behaviors with deviance. One situation that illustrates this is what you believe you&#8217;re to do if you find a wallet in the street. In the United States, turning the wallet in to local authorities would be considered the appropriate action, and to keep the wallet would be seen as deviant. In contrast, many Eastern societies would consider it much more appropriate to keep the wallet and search for the owner yourself; turning it over to someone else, even the authorities, would be considered deviant behavior. 
</p><section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1329337"><h4 data-type="title">Criticism</h4>
    <p id="import-auto-id1306677">Research done from this perspective is often scrutinized because of the difficulty of remaining objective. Others criticize the extremely narrow focus on symbolic interaction. Proponents, of course, consider this one of its greatest strengths.</p>
    </section><section data-depth="2" id="eip-672"><h4 data-type="title">Sociological Theory Today</h4><p id="eip-387">
These three approaches are still the main foundation of modern sociological theory, but some evolution has been seen. Structural-functionalism was a dominant force after World War II and until the 1960s and 1970s. At that time, sociologists began to feel that structural-functionalism did not sufficiently explain the rapid social changes happening in the United States at that time.
</p>
<p id="eip-id1166348062283">Conflict theory then gained prominence, as there was renewed emphasis on institutionalized social inequality. Critical theory, and the particular aspects of feminist theory and critical race theory, focused on creating social change through the application of sociological principles, and the field saw a renewed emphasis on helping ordinary people understand sociology principles, in the form of public sociology.
</p>
<p id="eip-id1166340221576">Postmodern social theory attempts to look at society through an entirely new lens by rejecting previous macro-level attempts to explain social phenomena. Generally considered as gaining acceptance in the late 1970s and early 1980s, postmodern social theory is a micro-level approach that looks at small, local groups and individual reality. Its growth in popularity coincides with the constructivist aspects of symbolic interactionism.</p></section>
