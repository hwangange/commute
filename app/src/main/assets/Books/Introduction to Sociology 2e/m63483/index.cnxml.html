      <p id="import-auto-id1163653049844">This book is written for you and is based on the teaching and research experience of numerous sociologists. In today&#8217;s global socially networked world, the topic of sociology is more relevant than ever before. We hope that through this book, you will learn how simple, everyday human actions and interactions can change the world. In this book, you will find applications of sociology concepts that are relevant, current, and balanced. </p></section>
    <section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1163651674898"><h3 data-type="title">To the Instructor</h3>
      <p id="import-auto-id1163652966284">This text is intended for a one-semester introductory course. Since current events influence our social perspectives and the field of sociology in general, OpenStax encourages instructors to keep this book fresh by sending in your up-to-date examples to Support@OpenStax.org so that students and instructors around the country can relate and engage in fruitful discussions. </p></section>
    <section data-depth="1" id="import-auto-id1163653051282"><h3 data-type="title">General Approach</h3>
      <p id="import-auto-id1163653050864"><em data-effect="italics">Introduction to Sociology 2e</em> adheres to the scope and sequence of a typical introductory sociology course. In addition to comprehensive coverage of core concepts, foundational scholars, and emerging theories we have incorporated section reviews with engaging questions, discussions that help students apply the sociological imagination, and features that draw learners into the discipline in meaningful ways. Although this text can be modified and reorganized to suit your needs, the standard version is organized so that topics are introduced conceptually, with relevant, everyday experiences. </p></section>
    <section data-depth="1" id="eip-312"><h3 data-type="title">Changes to the Second Edition</h3><p id="eip-142">Part of the mission of the second edition update was to ensure the research, examples and concepts used in this textbook are current and relevant to today&#8217;s student. To this end, we have rewritten the introduction of each chapter to reflect the latest developments in sociology, history and global culture. In addition to new graphs and images, the reader of the second edition will find new feature boxes on a diverse array of topics, which has been one of the goals of the update&#8212;bringing the world into greater focus through case studies on global culture.</p><p id="eip-745">For instance, since the first edition there have been major cultural shifts within the Middle East and Arab world&#8212;a movement still underway called the Arab Spring&#8212;changes that are now incorporated into our coverage on social movements and social unrest (Chapter 21, &#8220;Social Movements and Social Change&#8221;).  New issues in immigration, in the United States and across the world, have been brought to the forefront of the second edition, as rising income gaps and modern transportation are responsible for trends in Europe (fears of Islamic conservatism and economic recession) and political debates in the U.S. (such as border security, universal education and health care).</p><p id="eip-706">Since the first edition in 2012, technology and social media has ushered in new forms of communication, and, of course, these changes are altering the fabric of social life around the world. The benefits and downfalls of new technologies are reflected in new material in Chapter 4, &#8220;Society and Social Interaction,&#8221; where we discuss how social media is changing classical models of social stratification and prestige. </p><p id="eip-12">In addition to updating critical facts, data, and policies from the first edition, we have expanded on essential topics, including: </p><table id="eip-500" summary="Pictured is a two-column table. In the first column is 'Feminism and feminist theory,' 'US social stratification,' 'Transgender issues and changes to the DSM-V,' 'Marriage and pay equality,' 'The use of charter schools,' 'Impact of economy on population segments,' and 'Use of technology and social media by individuals and groups.' In the second column is 'Health care legislation,' 'Minimum wage policies,' 'Global statistics on education,' 'Competing theories of tolerance,' 'Cyberbullying,' 'Climate change debates,' 'Global population and demographic shifts,' and 'Net neutrality, online privacy and security.'" data-colsep="1" data-rowsep="0"><tbody>
