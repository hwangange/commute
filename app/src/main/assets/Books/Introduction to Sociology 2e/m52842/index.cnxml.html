</figure><p id="import-auto-id2269321">Why does deviance occur? How does it affect a society? Since the early days of sociology, scholars have developed theories that attempt to explain what deviance and crime mean to society. These theories can be grouped according to the three major sociological paradigms: functionalism, symbolic interactionism, and conflict theory.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1169033061641"><h3 data-type="title">Functionalism</h3>
        <p id="import-auto-id1359230">Sociologists who follow the functionalist approach are concerned with the way the different elements of a society contribute to the whole. They view deviance as a key component of a functioning society. Strain theory, social disorganization theory, and cultural deviance theory represent three functionalist perspectives on deviance in society.</p><section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1169033179630"><h4 data-type="title">&#201;mile Durkheim: The Essential Nature of Deviance</h4>
        <p id="import-auto-id2649102">&#201;mile Durkheim believed that deviance is a necessary part of a successful society. One way deviance is functional, he argued, is that it challenges people&#8217;s present views (1893). For instance, when black students across the United States participated in sit-ins during the civil rights movement, they challenged society&#8217;s notions of segregation. Moreover, Durkheim noted, when deviance is punished, it reaffirms currently held social norms, which also contributes to society (1893). Seeing a student given detention for skipping class reminds other high schoolers that playing hooky isn&#8217;t allowed and that they, too, could get detention. </p></section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1169033105104"><h4 data-type="title">Robert Merton: Strain Theory</h4>
        <p id="import-auto-id2850722">Sociologist Robert Merton agreed that deviance is an inherent part of a functioning society, but he expanded on Durkheim&#8217;s ideas by developing <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1652132">strain theory</span>, which notes that access to socially acceptable goals plays a part in determining whether a person conforms or deviates. From birth, we&#8217;re encouraged to achieve the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; of financial success. A woman who attends business school, receives her MBA, and goes on to make a million-dollar income as CEO of a company is said to be a success. However, not everyone in our society stands on equal footing. A person may have the socially acceptable goal of financial success but lack a socially acceptable way to reach that goal. According to Merton&#8217;s theory, an entrepreneur who can&#8217;t afford to launch his own company may be tempted to embezzle from his employer for start-up funds. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1761134">Merton defined five ways people respond to this gap between having a socially accepted goal and having no socially accepted way to pursue it.</p><ol id="fs-id2670263"><li><em data-effect="italics">Conformity</em>: Those who conform choose not to deviate. They pursue their goals to the extent that they can through socially accepted means. </li>
        <li><em data-effect="italics">Innovation</em>: Those who innovate pursue goals they cannot reach through legitimate means by instead using criminal or deviant means.</li>
       <li><em data-effect="italics">Ritualism</em>: People who ritualize lower their goals until they can reach them through socially acceptable ways. These members of society focus on conformity rather than attaining a distant dream. </li>
        <li><em data-effect="italics">Retreatism</em>: Others retreat and reject society&#8217;s goals and means. Some beggars and street people have withdrawn from society&#8217;s goal of financial success. </li>
        <li><em data-effect="italics">Rebellion</em>: A handful of people rebel and replace a society&#8217;s goals and means with their own. Terrorists or freedom fighters look to overthrow a society&#8217;s goals through socially unacceptable means.</li>
</ol></section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1169033100796"><h4 data-type="title">Social Disorganization Theory</h4>
        <p id="import-auto-id1303628">Developed by researchers at the University of Chicago in the 1920s and 1930s, <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1489642">social disorganization theory</span> asserts that crime is most likely to occur in communities with weak social ties and the absence of social control. An individual who grows up in a poor neighborhood with high rates of drug use, violence, teenage delinquency, and deprived parenting is more likely to become a criminal than an individual from a wealthy neighborhood with a good school system and families who are involved positively in the community. </p>
        <figure id="import-auto-id2851492"><figcaption>Proponents of social disorganization theory believe that individuals who grow up in impoverished areas are more likely to participate in deviant or criminal behaviors.

        </span>

</figure><p id="import-auto-id1648820">Social disorganization theory points to broad social factors as the cause of deviance. A person isn&#8217;t born a criminal but becomes one over time, often based on factors in his or her social environment. Research into social disorganization theory can greatly influence public policy. For instance, studies have found that children from disadvantaged communities who attend preschool programs that teach basic social skills are significantly less likely to engage in criminal activity.</p></section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1169033113923"><h4 data-type="title">Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay: Cultural Deviance Theory</h4>
        <p id="import-auto-id1195550"><span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1368771">Cultural deviance theory</span> suggests that conformity to the prevailing cultural norms of lower-class society causes crime. Researchers Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay (1942) studied crime patterns in Chicago in the early 1900s. They found that violence and crime were at their worst in the middle of the city and gradually decreased the farther someone traveled from the urban center toward the suburbs. Shaw and McKay noticed that this pattern matched the migration patterns of Chicago citizens. New immigrants, many of them poor and lacking knowledge of the English language, lived in neighborhoods inside the city. As the urban population expanded, wealthier people moved to the suburbs and left behind the less privileged.</p><p id="import-auto-id1982011">Shaw and McKay concluded that socioeconomic status correlated to race and ethnicity resulted in a higher crime rate. The mix of cultures and values created a smaller society with different ideas of deviance, and those values and ideas were transferred from generation to generation. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2886626">The theory of Shaw and McKay has been further tested and expounded upon by Robert Sampson and Byron Groves (1989). They found that poverty, ethnic diversity, and family disruption in given localities had a strong positive correlation with social disorganization. They also determined that social disorganization was, in turn, associated with high rates of crime and delinquency&#8212;or deviance. Recent studies Sampson conducted with Lydia Bean (2006) revealed similar findings. High rates of poverty and single-parent homes correlated with high rates of juvenile violence.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1169033062797"><h3 data-type="title">Conflict Theory</h3>
        <p id="import-auto-id1133547"><span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id2910344">Conflict theory</span> looks to social and economic factors as the causes of crime and deviance. Unlike functionalists, conflict theorists don&#8217;t see these factors as positive functions of society. They see them as evidence of inequality in the system. They also challenge social disorganization theory and control theory and argue that both ignore racial and socioeconomic issues and oversimplify social trends (Akers 1991). Conflict theorists also look for answers to the correlation of gender and race with wealth and crime.</p><section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1169033070881"><h4 data-type="title">Karl Marx: An Unequal System</h4>
        <p id="import-auto-id1662230"><span data-type="term">Conflict theory</span> was greatly influenced by the work of German philosopher, economist, and social scientist Karl Marx. Marx believed that the general population was divided into two groups. He labeled the wealthy, who controlled the means of production and business, the bourgeois. He labeled the workers who depended on the bourgeois for employment and survival the proletariat.  Marx believed that the bourgeois centralized their power and influence through government, laws, and other authority agencies in order to maintain and expand their positions of power in society.  Though Marx spoke little of deviance, his ideas created the foundation for conflict theorists who study the intersection of deviance and crime with wealth and power.  </p></section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1169033064662"><h4 data-type="title">C. Wright Mills: The Power Elite</h4>
        <p id="import-auto-id1392201">In his book <em data-effect="italics">The Power Elite</em> (1956), sociologist C. Wright Mills described the existence of what he dubbed the <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1669547">power elite</span>, a small group of wealthy and influential people at the top of society who hold the power and resources. Wealthy executives, politicians, celebrities, and military leaders often have access to national and international power, and in some cases, their decisions affect everyone in society. Because of this, the rules of society are stacked in favor of a privileged few who manipulate them to stay on top. It is these people who decide what is criminal and what is not, and the effects are often felt most by those who have little power. Mills&#8217; theories explain why celebrities such as Chris Brown and Paris Hilton, or once-powerful politicians such as Eliot Spitzer and Tom DeLay, can commit crimes and suffer little or no legal retribution. </p></section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1169033061495"><h4 data-type="title">Crime and Social Class</h4>
        <p id="import-auto-id1498996">While crime is often associated with the underprivileged, crimes committed by the wealthy and powerful remain an under-punished and costly problem within society. The FBI reported that victims of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft lost a total of $15.3 billion dollars in 2009 (FB1 2010). In comparison, when former advisor and financier Bernie Madoff was arrested in 2008, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reported that the estimated losses of his financial Ponzi scheme fraud were close to $50 billion (SEC 2009). </p><p id="import-auto-id2110556">This imbalance based on class power is also found within U.S. criminal law. In the 1980s, the use of crack cocaine (cocaine in its purest form) quickly became an epidemic that swept the country&#8217;s poorest urban communities. Its pricier counterpart, cocaine, was associated with upscale users and was a drug of choice for the wealthy. The legal implications of being caught by authorities with crack versus cocaine were starkly different. In 1986, federal law mandated that being caught in possession of 50 grams of crack was punishable by a ten-year prison sentence. An equivalent prison sentence for cocaine possession, however, required possession of 5,000 grams. In other words, the sentencing disparity was 1 to 100 (New York Times Editorial Staff 2011). This inequality in the severity of punishment for crack versus cocaine paralleled the unequal social class of respective users. A conflict theorist would note that those in society who hold the power are also the ones who make the laws concerning crime. In doing so, they make laws that will benefit them, while the powerless classes who lack the resources to make such decisions suffer the consequences. The crack-cocaine punishment disparity remained until 2010, when President Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act, which decreased the disparity to 1 to 18 (The Sentencing Project 2010).  </p><figure id="import-auto-id869143"><figcaption>From 1986 until 2010, the punishment for possessing crack, a &#8220;poor person&#8217;s drug,&#8221; was 100 times stricter than the punishment for cocaine use, a drug favored by the wealthy.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1169033056797"><h3 data-type="title">Symbolic Interactionism</h3>
        <p id="import-auto-id900210">Symbolic interactionism is a theoretical approach that can be used to explain how societies and/or social groups come to view behaviors as deviant or conventional. Labeling theory, differential association, social disorganization theory, and control theory fall within the realm of symbolic interactionism. </p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1169033069296"><h4 data-type="title">Labeling Theory</h4>
        <p id="import-auto-id2865647">Although all of us violate norms from time to time, few people would consider themselves deviant. Those who do, however, have often been labeled &#8220;deviant&#8221; by society and have gradually come to believe it themselves. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id3054668">Labeling theory</span> examines the ascribing of a deviant behavior to another person by members of society. Thus, what is considered deviant is determined not so much by the behaviors themselves or the people who commit them, but by the reactions of others to these behaviors. As a result, what is considered deviant changes over time and can vary significantly across cultures.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1353521">Sociologist Edwin Lemert expanded on the concepts of labeling theory and identified two types of deviance that affect identity formation. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1038620">Primary deviance</span> is a violation of norms that does not result in any long-term effects on the individual&#8217;s self-image or interactions with others. Speeding is a deviant act, but receiving a speeding ticket generally does not make others view you as a bad person, nor does it alter your own self-concept. Individuals who engage in primary deviance still maintain a feeling of belonging in society and are likely to continue to conform to norms in the future.</p><p id="import-auto-id2351172">Sometimes, in more extreme cases, primary deviance can morph into secondary deviance. <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id889910">Secondary deviance</span> occurs when a person&#8217;s self-concept and behavior begin to change after his or her actions are labeled as deviant by members of society. The person may begin to take on and fulfill the role of a &#8220;deviant&#8221; as an act of rebellion against the society that has labeled that individual as such. For example, consider a high school student who often cuts class and gets into fights. The student is reprimanded frequently by teachers and school staff, and soon enough, he develops a reputation as a &#8220;troublemaker.&#8221; As a result, the student starts acting out even more and breaking more rules; he has adopted the &#8220;troublemaker&#8221; label and embraced this deviant identity. Secondary deviance can be so strong that it bestows a <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1773248">master status</span> on an individual. A master status is a label that describes the chief characteristic of an individual. Some people see themselves primarily as doctors, artists, or grandfathers. Others see themselves as beggars, convicts, or addicts.</p>
<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id1306686" class="sociology-policy-debate" data-label=""><div data-type="title">The Right to Vote</div>
        <p id="import-auto-id2754738">Before she lost her job as an administrative assistant, Leola Strickland postdated and mailed a handful of checks for amounts ranging from $90 to $500. By the time she was able to find a new job, the checks had bounced, and she was convicted of fraud under Mississippi law. Strickland pleaded guilty to a felony charge and repaid her debts; in return, she was spared from serving prison time. </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id1461812">Strickland appeared in court in 2001. More than ten years later, she is still feeling the sting of her sentencing. Why? Because Mississippi is one of twelve states in the United States that bans convicted felons from voting (ProCon 2011).</p><p id="import-auto-id2388714">To Strickland, who said she had always voted, the news came as a great shock. She isn&#8217;t alone. Some 5.3 million people in the United States are currently barred from voting because of felony convictions (ProCon 2009). These individuals include inmates, parolees, probationers, and even people who have never been jailed, such as Leola Strickland.</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2111192">Under the Fourteenth Amendment, states are allowed to deny voting privileges to individuals who have participated in &#8220;rebellion or other crime&#8221; (Krajick 2004). Although there are no federally mandated laws on the matter, most states practice at least one form of <em data-effect="italics">felony disenfranchisement</em>. At present, it&#8217;s estimated that approximately 2.4 percent of the possible voting population is disfranchised, that is, lacking the right to vote (ProCon 2011).</p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2217671">Is it fair to prevent citizens from participating in such an important process? Proponents of disfranchisement laws argue that felons have a debt to pay to society. Being stripped of their right to vote is part of the punishment for criminal deeds. Such proponents point out that voting isn&#8217;t the only instance in which ex-felons are denied rights; state laws also ban released criminals from holding public office, obtaining professional licenses, and sometimes even inheriting property (Lott and Jones 2008). </p>
        <p id="import-auto-id2784105">Opponents of felony disfranchisement in the United States argue that voting is a basic human right and should be available to all citizens regardless of past deeds. Many point out that felony disfranchisement has its roots in the 1800s, when it was used primarily to block black citizens from voting. Even nowadays, these laws disproportionately target poor minority members, denying them a chance to participate in a system that, as a social conflict theorist would point out, is already constructed to their disadvantage (Holding 2006). Those who cite labeling theory worry that denying deviants the right to vote will only further encourage deviant behavior. If ex-criminals are disenfranchised from voting, are they being disenfranchised from society? </p>

        <p id="import-auto-id1169033062788">In the early 1900s, sociologist Edwin Sutherland sought to understand how deviant behavior developed among people. Since criminology was a young field, he drew on other aspects of sociology including social interactions and group learning (Laub 2006). His conclusions established <span data-type="term" id="import-auto-id1169033068553">differential association theory</span>, which suggested that individuals learn deviant behavior from those close to them who provide models of and opportunities for deviance. According to Sutherland, deviance is less a personal choice and more a result of differential socialization processes. A tween whose friends are sexually active is more likely to view sexual activity as acceptable. </p><p id="import-auto-id1169033103819">Sutherland&#8217;s theory may explain why crime is multigenerational. A longitudinal study beginning in the 1960s found that the best predictor of antisocial and criminal behavior in children was whether their parents had been convicted of a crime (Todd and Jury 1996). Children who were younger than ten years old when their parents were convicted were more likely than other children to engage in spousal abuse and criminal behavior by their early thirties. Even when taking socioeconomic factors such as dangerous neighborhoods, poor school systems, and overcrowded housing into consideration, researchers found that parents were the main influence on the behavior of their offspring (Todd and Jury 1996). </p></section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1169033117716"><h4 data-type="title">Travis Hirschi: Control Theory</h4>
        <p id="import-auto-id1169033071127">Continuing with an examination of large social factors, <strong>control theory</strong> states that social control is directly affected by the strength of social bonds and that deviance results from a feeling of disconnection from society. Individuals who believe they are a part of society are less likely to commit crimes against it.</p><p id="import-auto-id1169033119673">Travis Hirschi (1969) identified four types of social bonds that connect people to society: </p>
<ol id="fs-id1169034179761"><li><em data-effect="italics">Attachment</em> measures our connections to others. When we are closely attached to people, we worry about their opinions of us. People conform to society&#8217;s norms in order to gain approval (and prevent disapproval) from family, friends, and romantic partners.</li>
        <li><em data-effect="italics">Commitment</em> refers to the investments we make in the community. A well-respected local businesswoman who volunteers at her synagogue and is a member of the neighborhood block organization has more to lose from committing a crime than a woman who doesn&#8217;t have a career or ties to the community. </li>
        <li>Similarly, levels of <em data-effect="italics">involvement</em>, or participation in socially legitimate activities, lessen a person&#8217;s likelihood of deviance. Children who are members of little league baseball teams have fewer family crises. </li>
        <li>The final bond, <em data-effect="italics">belief</em>, is an agreement on common values in society. If a person views social values as beliefs, he or she will conform to them. An environmentalist is more likely to pick up trash in a park, because a clean environment is a social value to him (Hirschi 1969). </li>

        <p id="import-auto-id1169033069324">The three major sociological paradigms offer different explanations for the motivation behind deviance and crime. Functionalists point out that deviance is a social necessity since it reinforces norms by reminding people of the consequences of violating them. Violating norms can open society&#8217;s eyes to injustice in the system. Conflict theorists argue that crime stems from a system of inequality that keeps those with power at the top and those without power at the bottom. Symbolic interactionists focus attention on the socially constructed nature of the labels related to deviance. Crime and deviance are learned from the environment and enforced or discouraged by those around us. </p>

        <p id="import-auto-id1169033066434">The Skull and Bones Society made news in 2004 when it was revealed that then-President George W. Bush and his Democratic challenger, John Kerry, had both been members at Yale University. In the years since, conspiracy theorists have linked the secret society to numerous world events, arguing that many of the nation&#8217;s most powerful people are former Bonesmen. Although such ideas may raise a lot of skepticism, many influential people of the past century have been Skull and Bones Society members, and the society is sometimes described as a college version of the power elite. Journalist Rebecca Leung discusses the roots of the club and the impact its ties between decision-makers can have later in life.
