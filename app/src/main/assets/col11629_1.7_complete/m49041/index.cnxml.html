    <p id="fs-idm58596496">The <span data-type="term">visible spectrum</span> is the portion of the larger <span data-type="term">electromagnetic spectrum</span> that we can see. As <a href="#Figure_05_02_Spectrum" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows, the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all of the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our environment and includes gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet light, visible light, infrared light, microwaves, and radio waves. The visible spectrum in humans is associated with wavelengths that range from 380 to 740 nm&#8212;a very small distance, since a nanometer (nm) is one billionth of a meter. Other species can detect other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. For instance, honeybees can see light in the ultraviolet range (Wakakuwa, Stavenga, &amp; Arikawa, 2007), and some snakes can detect infrared radiation in addition to more traditional visual light cues (Chen, Deng, Brauth, Ding, &amp; Tang, 2012; Hartline, Kass, &amp; Loop, 1978).</p>

  <section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp5113616"><h3 data-type="title">SOUND WAVES</h3>
    <p id="fs-idm2640704">Like light waves, the physical properties of sound waves are associated with various aspects of our perception of sound. The frequency of a sound wave is associated with our perception of that sound&#8217;s <span data-type="term">pitch</span>. High-frequency sound waves are perceived as high-pitched sounds, while low-frequency sound waves are perceived as low-pitched sounds. The audible range of sound frequencies is between 20 and 20000 Hz, with greatest sensitivity to those frequencies that fall in the middle of this range.</p> 
    <p id="fs-idp89513280">As was the case with the visible spectrum, other species show differences in their audible ranges. For instance, chickens have a very limited audible range, from 125 to 2000 Hz. Mice have an audible range from 1000 to 91000 Hz, and the beluga whale&#8217;s audible range is from 1000 to 123000 Hz. Our pet dogs and cats have audible ranges of about 70&#8211;45000 Hz and 45&#8211;64000 Hz, respectively (Strain, 2003).</p>
    <p id="fs-idp9306416">The loudness of a given sound is closely associated with the amplitude of the sound wave. Higher amplitudes are associated with louder sounds. Loudness is measured in terms of <span data-type="term">decibels (dB)</span>, a logarithmic unit of sound intensity. A typical conversation would correlate with 60 dB; a rock concert might check in at 120 dB (<a href="#Figure_05_02_AudRange" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). A whisper 5 feet away or rustling leaves are at the low end of our hearing range; sounds like a window air conditioner, a normal conversation, and even heavy traffic or a vacuum cleaner are within a tolerable range. However, there is the potential for hearing damage from about 80 dB to 130 dB: These are sounds of a food processor, power lawnmower, heavy truck (25 feet away), subway train (20 feet away), live rock music, and a jackhammer. The threshold for pain is about 130 dB, a jet plane taking off or a revolver firing at close range (Dunkle, 1982).</p>

    <p id="fs-idm60185952">Although wave amplitude is generally associated with loudness, there is some interaction between frequency and amplitude in our perception of loudness within the audible range. For example, a 10 Hz sound wave is inaudible no matter the amplitude of the wave. A 1000 Hz sound wave, on the other hand, would vary dramatically in terms of perceived loudness as the amplitude of the wave increased.</p>

    <p id="fs-idm21712160">Both light and sound can be described in terms of wave forms with physical characteristics like amplitude, wavelength, and timbre. Wavelength and frequency are inversely related so that longer waves have lower frequencies, and shorter waves have higher frequencies. In the visual system, a light wave&#8217;s wavelength is generally associated with color, and its amplitude is associated with brightness. In the auditory system, a sound&#8217;s frequency is associated with pitch, and its amplitude is associated with loudness.</p>

        <p id="fs-idm69591376">Once again, one could make an evolutionary argument here. Given that the human voice falls in this middle range and the importance of communication among humans, one could argue that it is quite adaptive to have an audible range that centers on this particular type of stimulus.</p>

        <p id="fs-idm56237920">If you grew up with a family pet, then you have surely noticed that they often seem to hear things that you don&#8217;t hear. Now that you&#8217;ve read this section, you probably have some insight as to why this may be. How would you explain this to a friend who never had the opportunity to take a class like this?</p>
