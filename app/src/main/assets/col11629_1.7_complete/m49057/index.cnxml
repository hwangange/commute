<para id="fs-idp7406912">People face problems every day—usually, multiple problems throughout the day. Sometimes these problems are straightforward: To double a recipe for pizza dough, for example, all that is required is that each ingredient in the recipe be doubled. Sometimes, however, the problems we encounter are more complex. For example, say you have a work deadline, and you must mail a printed copy of a report to your supervisor by the end of the business day. The report is time-sensitive and must be sent overnight. You finished the report last night, but your printer will not work today. What should you do? First, you need to identify the problem and then apply a strategy for solving the problem.</para>
<section id="fs-idm10771072">
<title>PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES</title>
<para id="fs-idm55655984">When you are presented with a problem—whether it is a complex mathematical problem or a broken printer, how do you solve it? Before finding a solution to the problem, the problem must first be clearly identified. After that, one of many problem solving strategies can be applied, hopefully resulting in a solution.</para>
<para id="fs-idm81082576">A <term>problem-solving strategy</term> is a plan of action used to find a solution. Different strategies have different action plans associated with them (<link target-id="Table_07_03_01"/>). For example, a well-known strategy is <term>trial and error</term>. The old adage, “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again” describes trial and error. In terms of your broken printer, you could try checking the ink levels, and if that doesn’t work, you could check to make sure the paper tray isn’t jammed. Or maybe the printer isn’t actually connected to your laptop. When using trial and error, you would continue to try different solutions until you solved your problem. Although trial and error is not typically one of the most time-efficient strategies, it is a commonly used one.</para>
<table id="Table_07_03_01" summary="A three column table describes problem solving strategies. From left to right the columns are labeled &#x201C;Method; Description; and Example.&#x201D; The first row, respectively, reads: &#x201C;trial and error; continue trying different solutions until problem is solved; and restarting phone, turning off wifi, turning off Bluetooth in order to determine why your phone is malfunctioning.&#x201D; The second row reads: &#x201C;algorithm; step-by-step problem-solving formula; and instruction manual for installing new software on your computer.&#x201D; The third row reads: &#x201C;heuristic; general problem-solving framework; and working backwards, breaking a task into steps.&#x201D;"><title>Problem-Solving Strategies</title>

</table><para id="fs-idm40583184">Another type of strategy is an algorithm. An <term>algorithm</term> is a problem-solving formula that provides you with step-by-step instructions used to achieve a desired outcome (Kahneman, 2011). You can think of an algorithm as a recipe with highly detailed instructions that produce the same result every time they are performed. Algorithms are used frequently in our everyday lives, especially in computer science. When you run a search on the Internet, search engines like Google use algorithms to decide which entries will appear first in your list of results. Facebook also uses algorithms to decide which posts to display on your newsfeed. Can you identify other situations in which algorithms are used?</para>
<para id="fs-idp8055712">A heuristic is another type of problem solving strategy. While an algorithm must be followed exactly to produce a correct result, a <term>heuristic</term> is a general problem-solving framework (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974). You can think of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems. A “rule of thumb” is an example of a heuristic. Such a rule saves the person time and energy when making a decision, but despite its time-saving characteristics, it is not always the best method for making a rational decision. Different types of heuristics are used in different types of situations, but the impulse to use a heuristic occurs when one of five conditions is met (Pratkanis, 1989):</para>
<list id="fs-idm24198944" list-type="bulleted">
<item>When one is faced with too much information</item>
<item>When the time to make a decision is limited</item> 
<item>When the decision to be made is unimportant</item>
<item>When there is access to very little information to use in making the decision</item>
<item>When an appropriate heuristic happens to come to mind in the same moment</item>
</list>
<para id="fs-idm161874848"><term>Working backwards</term> is a useful heuristic in which you begin solving the problem by focusing on the end result. Consider this example: You live in Washington, D.C. and have been invited to a wedding at 4 PM on Saturday in Philadelphia. Knowing that Interstate 95 tends to back up any day of the week, you need to plan your route and time your departure accordingly. If you want to be at the wedding service by 3:30 PM, and it takes 2.5 hours to get to Philadelphia without traffic, what time should you leave your house? You use the working backwards heuristic to plan the events of your day on a regular basis, probably without even thinking about it.</para>
<para id="fs-idm26711856">Another useful heuristic is the practice of accomplishing a large goal or task by breaking it into a series of smaller steps. Students often use this common method to complete a large research project or long essay for school. For example, students typically brainstorm, develop a thesis or main topic, research the chosen topic, organize their information into an outline, write a rough draft, revise and edit the rough draft, develop a final draft, organize the references list, and proofread their work before turning in the project. The large task becomes less overwhelming when it is broken down into a series of small steps.</para>
<note id="fs-idp39443200" class="psychology everyday-connection"><label>Everyday Connection</label><title>Solving Puzzles</title>
<para id="fs-idm81906192">Problem-solving abilities can improve with practice. Many people challenge themselves every day with puzzles and other mental exercises to sharpen their problem-solving skills. Sudoku puzzles appear daily in most newspapers. Typically, a sudoku puzzle is a 9×9 grid. The simple sudoku below (<link target-id="Figure_07_03_Sudoku"/>) is a 4×4 grid. To solve the puzzle, fill in the empty boxes with a single digit: 1, 2, 3, or 4. Here are the rules: The numbers must total 10 in each bolded box, each row, and each column; however, each digit can only appear once in a bolded box, row, and column. Time yourself as you solve this puzzle and compare your time with a classmate.</para>

<section id="fs-idp55827040"><title>PITFALLS TO PROBLEM SOLVING</title><para id="fs-idp83546720">Not all problems are successfully solved, however. What challenges stop us from successfully solving a problem? Albert Einstein once said, “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.” Imagine a person in a room that has four doorways. One doorway that has always been open in the past is now locked. The person, accustomed to exiting the room by that particular doorway, keeps trying to get out through the same doorway even though the other three doorways are open. The person is stuck—but she just needs to go to another doorway, instead of trying to get out through the locked doorway. A <term>mental set</term> is where you persist in approaching a problem in a way that has worked in the past but is clearly not working now.</para>
<para id="fs-idp7857216"><term>Functional fixedness</term> is a type of mental set where you cannot perceive an object being used for something other than what it was designed for. During the <emphasis effect="italics">Apollo 13</emphasis> mission to the moon, NASA engineers at Mission Control had to overcome functional fixedness to save the lives of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft. An explosion in a module of the spacecraft damaged multiple systems. The astronauts were in danger of being poisoned by rising levels of carbon dioxide because of problems with the carbon dioxide filters. The engineers found a way for the astronauts to use spare plastic bags, tape, and air hoses to create a makeshift air filter, which saved the lives of the astronauts.</para>

</note><para id="fs-idp34596688">Researchers have investigated whether functional fixedness is affected by culture. In one experiment, individuals from the Shuar group in Ecuador were asked to use an object for a purpose other than that for which the object was originally intended. For example, the participants were told a story about a bear and a rabbit that were separated by a river and asked to select among various objects, including a spoon, a cup, erasers, and so on, to help the animals. The spoon was the only object long enough to span the imaginary river, but if the spoon was presented in a way that reflected its normal usage, it took participants longer to choose the spoon to solve the problem. (German &amp; Barrett, 2005). The researchers wanted to know if exposure to highly specialized tools, as occurs with individuals in industrialized nations, affects their ability to transcend functional fixedness. It was determined that functional fixedness is experienced in both industrialized and nonindustrialized cultures (German &amp; Barrett, 2005).</para><para id="fs-idm130151376">In order to make good decisions, we use our knowledge and our reasoning. Often, this knowledge and reasoning is sound and solid. Sometimes, however, we are swayed by biases or by others manipulating a situation. For example, let’s say you and three friends wanted to rent a house and had a combined target budget of $1,600. The realtor shows you only very run-down houses for $1,600 and then shows you a very nice house for $2,000. Might you ask each person to pay more in rent to get the $2,000 home? Why would the realtor show you the run-down houses and the nice house? The realtor may be challenging your anchoring bias. An <term>anchoring bias</term> occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving a problem. In this case, you’re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point.</para><para id="fs-idm73967264">The <term>confirmation bias</term> is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs. For example, if you think that your professor is not very nice, you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis. <term>Hindsight bias</term> leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable, even though it really wasn’t. In other words, you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did. <term>Representative bias</term> describes a faulty way of thinking, in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something; for example, you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation, because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors.</para> 
<para id="fs-idp35880832">Finally, the <term>availability heuristic</term> is a heuristic in which you make a decision based on an example, information, or recent experience that is that readily available to you, even though it may not be the best example to inform your decision<emphasis>.</emphasis> Biases tend to “preserve that which is already established—to maintain our preexisting knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and hypotheses” (Aronson, 1995; Kahneman, 2011). These biases are summarized in <link target-id="Table_07_03_02"/>.</para>
