  <p id="fs-idm37353248"><span data-type="term">Dissociative disorders</span> are characterized by an individual becoming split off, or dissociated, from her core sense of self. Memory and identity become disturbed; these disturbances have a psychological rather than physical cause. Dissociative disorders listed in the DSM-5 include dissociative amnesia, depersonalization/derealization disorder, and dissociative identity disorder. </p>
  
  <section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp36883920"><h3 data-type="title">DISSOCIATIVE AMNESIA</h3>
    <p id="fs-idm91653520">Amnesia refers to the partial or total forgetting of some experience or event. An individual with <span data-type="term">dissociative amnesia</span> is unable to recall important personal information, usually following an extremely stressful or traumatic experience such as combat, natural disasters, or being the victim of violence. The memory impairments are not caused by ordinary forgetting. Some individuals with dissociative amnesia will also experience <span data-type="term">dissociative fugue</span> (from the word &#8220;to flee&#8221; in French), whereby they suddenly wander away from their home, experience confusion about their identity, and sometimes even adopt a new identity (Carde&#241;a &amp; Gleaves, 2006). Most fugue episodes last only a few hours or days, but some can last longer. One study of residents in communities in upstate New York reported that about 1.8% experienced dissociative amnesia in the previous year (Johnson, Cohen, Kasen, &amp; Brook, 2006). </p>
    <p id="fs-idm39692688">Some have questioned the validity of dissociative amnesia (Pope, Hudson, Bodkin, &amp; Oliva, 1998); it has even been characterized as a &#8220;piece of psychiatric folklore devoid of convincing empirical support&#8221; (McNally, 2003, p. 275). Notably, scientific publications regarding dissociative amnesia rose during the 1980s and reached a peak in the mid-1990s, followed by an equally sharp decline by 2003; in fact, only 13 cases of individuals with dissociative amnesia worldwide could be found in the literature that same year (Pope, Barry, Bodkin, &amp; Hudson, 2006). Further, no description of individuals showing dissociative amnesia following a trauma exists in any fictional or nonfictional work prior to 1800 (Pope, Poliakoff, Parker, Boynes, &amp; Hudson, 2006). However, a study of 82 individuals who enrolled for treatment at a psychiatric outpatient hospital found that nearly 10% met the criteria for dissociative amnesia, perhaps suggesting that the condition is underdiagnosed, especially in psychiatric populations (Foote, Smolin, Kaplan, Legatt, &amp; Lipschitz, 2006). </p>

  <section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp13195632"><h3 data-type="title">DEPERSONALIZATION/DEREALIZATION DISORDER</h3>
    <p id="fs-idm4901216"><span data-type="term">Depersonalization/derealization disorder</span> is characterized by recurring episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization is defined as feelings of &#8220;unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, one&#8217;s whole self or from aspects of the self&#8221; (APA, 2013, p. 302). Individuals who experience <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">depersonalization</span> might believe their thoughts and feelings are not their own; they may feel robotic as though they lack control over their movements and speech; they may experience a distorted sense of time and, in extreme cases, they may sense an &#8220;out-of-body&#8221; experience in which they see themselves from the vantage point of another person. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Derealization</span> is conceptualized as a sense of &#8220;unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals, inanimate objects, or all surroundings&#8221; (APA, 2013, p. 303). A person who experiences derealization might feel as though he is in a fog or a dream, or that the surrounding world is somehow artificial and unreal. Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder often have difficulty describing their symptoms and may think they are going crazy (APA, 2013). </p>

  <section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm34296960"><h3 data-type="title">DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER</h3>
    <p id="fs-idm95109648">By far, the most well-known dissociative disorder is <span data-type="term">dissociative identity disorder</span> (formerly called multiple personality disorder). People with dissociative identity disorder exhibit two or more separate personalities or identities, each well-defined and distinct from one another. They also experience memory gaps for the time during which another identity is in charge (e.g., one might find unfamiliar items in her shopping bags or among her possessions), and in some cases may report hearing voices, such as a child&#8217;s voice or the sound of somebody crying (APA, 2013). The study of upstate New York residents mentioned above (Johnson et al., 2006) reported that 1.5% of their sample experienced symptoms consistent with dissociative identity disorder in the previous year. </p>
    
    <p id="fs-idm4078704">Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is highly controversial. Some believe that people fake symptoms to avoid the consequences of illegal actions (e.g., &#8220;I am not responsible for shoplifting because it was my other personality&#8221;). In fact, it has been demonstrated that people are generally skilled at adopting the role of a person with different personalities when they believe it might be advantageous to do so. As an example, Kenneth Bianchi was an infamous serial killer who, along with his cousin, murdered over a dozen females around Los Angeles in the late 1970s. Eventually, he and his cousin were apprehended. At Bianchi&#8217;s trial, he pled not guilty by reason of insanity, presenting himself as though he had DID and claiming that a different personality (&#8220;Steve Walker&#8221;) committed the murders. When these claims were scrutinized, he admitted faking the symptoms and was found guilty (Schwartz, 1981). </p>
    
    <p id="fs-idp33503824">A second reason DID is controversial is because rates of the disorder suddenly skyrocketed in the 1980s. More cases of DID were identified during the five years prior to 1986 than in the preceding two centuries (Putnam, Guroff, Silberman, Barban, &amp; Post, 1986). Although this increase may be due to the development of more sophisticated diagnostic techniques, it is also possible that the popularization of DID&#8212;helped in part by <em data-effect="italics">Sybil</em>, a popular 1970s book (and later film) about a woman with 16 different personalities&#8212;may have prompted clinicians to overdiagnose the disorder (Piper &amp; Merskey, 2004). Casting further scrutiny on the existence of multiple personalities or identities is the recent suggestion that the story of Sybil was largely fabricated, and the idea for the book might have been exaggerated (Nathan, 2011).</p>
    
    <p id="fs-idm36203904">Despite its controversial nature, DID is clearly a legitimate and serious disorder, and although some people may fake symptoms, others suffer their entire lives with it. People with this disorder tend to report a history of childhood trauma, some cases having been corroborated through medical or legal records (Carde&#241;a &amp; Gleaves, 2006). Research by Ross et al. (1990) suggests that in one study about 95% of people with DID were physically and/or sexually abused as children. Of course, not all reports of childhood abuse can be expected to be valid or accurate. However, there is strong evidence that traumatic experiences can cause people to experience states of dissociation, suggesting that dissociative states&#8212;including the adoption of multiple personalities&#8212;may serve as a psychologically important coping mechanism for threat and danger (Dalenberg et al., 2012). </p>

    <section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm154784080" class="summary"><h3 data-type="title">Summary</h3><p id="fs-idm96249648">The main characteristic of dissociative disorders is that people become dissociated from their sense of self, resulting in memory and identity disturbances. Dissociative disorders listed in the DSM-5 include dissociative amnesia, depersonalization/derealization disorder, and dissociative identity disorder. A person with dissociative amnesia is unable to recall important personal information, often after a stressful or traumatic experience. </p>
      
      <p id="fs-idm108057536">Depersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by recurring episodes of depersonalization (i.e., detachment from or unfamiliarity with the self) and/or derealization (i.e., detachment from or unfamiliarity with the world). A person with dissociative identity disorder exhibits two or more well-defined and distinct personalities or identities, as well as memory gaps for the time during which another identity was present. </p>
      
      <p id="fs-idm42826064">Dissociative identity disorder has generated controversy, mainly because some believe its symptoms can be faked by patients if presenting its symptoms somehow benefits the patient in avoiding negative consequences or taking responsibility for one&#8217;s actions. The diagnostic rates of this disorder have increased dramatically following its portrayal in popular culture. However, many people legitimately suffer over the course of a lifetime with this disorder.</p>

        <p id="fs-idm23003888">The prevalence of most psychological disorders has increased since the 1980s. However, as discussed in this section, scientific publications regarding dissociative amnesia peaked in the mid-1990s but then declined steeply through 2003. In addition, no fictional or nonfictional description of individuals showing dissociative amnesia following a trauma exists prior to 1800. How would you explain this phenomenon?</p>
      </div>
      <div data-type="solution" id="fs-idm10598800">
        <p id="fs-idm68759632">Several explanations are possible. One explanation is that perhaps there is little scientific interest in this phenomenon, maybe because it has yet to gain consistent scientific acceptance. Another possible explanation is that perhaps the dissociative amnesia was fashionable at the time publications dealing with this topic peaked (1990s); perhaps since that time it has become less fashionable.</p>
